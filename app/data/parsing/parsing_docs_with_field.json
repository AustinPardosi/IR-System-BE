Information transfer in libraries isrestricted to the use of documents.  It takes noaccount of documents used outside the library, stillless of information transferred orally from personto person.  The library acts as a channel in only aproportion of the situations in which information istransferred.Taking technical information transfer as a whole,there is no doubt that this proportion is not themajor one.  There are users of technical information -particularly in technology rather than science -who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on deskcollections of handbooks, current periodicals and personalcontact with their colleagues and with people in otherorganizations.

This, be it noted, is most evident infiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the packis virtually impossible and where co-operation without fightingis necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbiallypeaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and oftenfatal attacks on the weaker mate.In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how inthe human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, andnot guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, theaggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found inanimals.

However up until the forties the overwhelmingmajority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraicstructures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The firstgeneral theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitraryoperations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basicprinciples of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Suchsets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory madeabundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility ofmaking fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras butalso the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory wasdiscovered by the author in 1936.During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that thetheory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimatelyrelated despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  Andit is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systemsdealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations andrelations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is thelanguage of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory canbe considered to border on logic and algebra.",

Thus, we will findin the literature both a frankly subjective notion ofrelevance as reported by individual users, and equations,curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably providenumerical measures of the recall and relevancecharacteristics of information systems.  This phenomenonof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjectiveand non-mathematical term to equations in which thesame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematicaldefinition has its ancient parallel in discussionsof probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate themeaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand,the use of a single term in the same document to covertwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such ausage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrineby attributing to it mathematical validity which it doesnot have, represents a more serious situation than merelycareless ambiguity.",

Merton originally introducedthe concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors ofmultiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept isgeneralized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effectwere to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should beinfluenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies ofsimilar design.  In each study we control for the number of citationspapers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups ofpapers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.We then see whether there were any differences in the reception ofthese papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author'slocation in the stratification system.  All the data indicatethat assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more importantdeterminant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratificationvariables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal qualityis influenced by the reputation of the author based on past workthat is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  TheMatthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigiouspoints of the social system of science.  All other stratificationvariables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awardsdid not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented thatindicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are nomore likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focusattention on the work of little-known men who collaborate withscientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibilityof the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.

There seemedto be no practicable way to measure the quality of largenumbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers ofscientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable toolto measure the significance of individual scientists'contributions.

The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishmentof many new library consortia, and there were some tentative effortsto use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\"These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of beingcost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not onlypromises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses newproblems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutionsrequires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importanceto a clear understanding of the information needs of specific usersubgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planningand design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\"issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems andconsiderations.One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growthin the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operatedby the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  Theapparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the sameproblems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation amonglibrary and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printedmaterials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or lessrapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  Theinclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over theownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of thatcontroversy - the role of government and non-profit information servicesin relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year'schapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.",

A decision has alsoalready been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfieldresults that appear to provide evidence of the superiority ofnatural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarilybecause these results were restricted to tests on an aeronauticalcollection, and it may well be that the natural language of thisdiscipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which iscertainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language ofmanagement.

One must isolate and define a problem and,as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors areeliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageableproportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort ofhypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtainingevidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise justthat crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence uponwhich to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, oneis ready for a further step forward, and so on.

The degree oforder attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on thebasis of six postulates.

The central theme of the work is a relatively newconcept - the rise of an \"anthropological\" species we call theauthoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older stylehe seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highlyindustrialized society with irrational or anti-rationalbeliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proudto be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to powerand authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflictingtrends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers andpolitical thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means ofsocio-psychological research.",

Many people in the companywere directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had intereststhat were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquaintingthem with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilationof relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on thetheory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures wouldbe a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entirerange of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole isconcerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact thatall but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either asemployees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDChas had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management wasenthusiastic in its support of the new project.",

Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggestthat increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over thepast two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume ofservice, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth ofservices.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries thedescriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; theweighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librariansto reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall servicesrelative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a singlefigure..

The primary test data are summarizedas statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents inthe test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of themean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability affordedby its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection,processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gainrealized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particularlibrary, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variablescan be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the statusstatistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictionsof basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of thiswork is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decisionaids in managing a basic library service..

Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or arecorrelated according to some system with certain physical or conceptualentities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to theengineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message isone selected from a set of possible messages.

As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters ingeneral approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  Thereare, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change ofemphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results toparticular cases.We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results withthe greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, sincethis would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and wouldobscure the main thread of the analysis.

Some of the most militant of American radicals, in theNew Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at leasttemporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In somepart it is due to the fact that these social movements are still newand their political activism consumes their necessarily limitedenergies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need timeto produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory isscarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the factthat American radicals are often more American than they know andmay prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to theintangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoreticalproblems is probably due to the close links that some young radicalshave with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose moreexpressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culturedispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" ofintellectual confrontation.

This is more suited toimplementation on storage devices.This method treats text as a string of charactersrather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsetsof strings such that their frequencies of occurrence aremore even than those of word types.  The members of thissubset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  Therectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a muchsimplified file organization and promises considerablecost advantages.",

To take but onefield, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papersto be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first millionto be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where onemillion papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - andbefore 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equalto the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will bepublished and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial beganpublication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science MuseumLibrary was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only afurther 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the useof scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 theN.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the ScienceMuseum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that ofall the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a periodwhich itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application forpeaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in syntheticmaterials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examplesmay not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be ata very high level indeed.",

This is probably due in large part to the fact that there areextremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine andstate user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests anapproach or point of view that might help this situation by providing amethod of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a moreconvenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes severalexamples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data thatsupport these statements.In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirementsof workers in the field of science and technology, with no seriousattempt made to include workers in other fields.

The techniques of detailed depthclassification have been greatly developed during the past decade,and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than thetraditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.These developments have been reported mainly as research papersin a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarilydifficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.There is a need for a more simply written and more readilyavailable practical guide to the use of the newer techniques ofclassification.",

Thesophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products inwhich we engage today, which require vast research expenditures tofind the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or themost accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces anincrease in the national level of scientific and technological competencethat has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.

The existence of such on-linenetworks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibilityof having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.",

Although effectiveness-typecriteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance thestate-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriatefor operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion thattakes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem ofoperating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexingpossible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level ofeffectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human,machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type ofcriterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approachis described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and ofeffectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how toreduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems ofdefining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discretesteps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans andsmall-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..",

For themost part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have beenconducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, ashas been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbeyand Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12)..

Such avocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much morepowerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been availableheretofore..

It is thepurpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for theautomatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of theoriginal document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under whichvarious methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to developcriteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstractcan be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant tothe abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the mostsignificant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection andrejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentencereference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automaticabstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, calledthe Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functionsspecified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are ofsufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methodsof the automatic abstracting system is warranted..",

In terms of thisframework, the former have concentrated on automatingthe operations of the component for content analysisand representation, while the latter have emphasizedthe data management component.

With this technique thegreater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. Thetitle-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. Thesequeries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is comparedwith the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search withfixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus therelative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that thechoice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..",

Consequently, theprocess of query formulation by the user, interactively with theinformation available in te system, remains one of the principalproblems in information retrieval today..In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interfacecommunication between man and the computer, we have pursued theobjective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRTin a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with alight pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Usinghis passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interactionvocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, ahierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may beaugmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance tothe user..

Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales onwhich a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in thedevelopment of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or moreindependent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identifythose clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-orientedreference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line referenceretrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factoranalyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I waslabeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the totalvariance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accountedfor over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factorstructure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived threedimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more generalclass of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured systemevaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjectivescales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structureand the need for a predicative replication of the study..",

    "words": "Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrievenot documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasionsdetermined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of thetechniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" areretrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providingor \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the documentcontaining it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e.,single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantagesfor screening retrieval output..Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relationbetween clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximatessyntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntacticjoints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuationmarks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses wordproximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determiningwhen a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedurewas found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages,which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve twoanswer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because ofone multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failureof clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents theyretrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART,which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used inthis study were from the field of information science.. The results of thestudy are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" andit is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologiesthe techniques described will work even better.. On this basis adissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..",

Thus, givenan arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machinecan elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevantdocuments that would not otherwise have been selected..Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole libraryproblem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis ofwhich the library system makes a concatenated statistical inferencein order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documentswhich most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..",

Use of the IUPAC cipher has provedadvantageous as regards speed and cost of both input and searching.  Formost searches, scanning of the information explicit in the cipher has provedadequate.  Our computer programs also enable conversion of ciphers into atom-connection tables and generation of fragmentation codes.  The integrated useof these facilities and their merits relative to other approaches are discussed.",

Most of thesesystems are also capable of handling certain fragmentrequests; however, the fragments which can be processedare frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, inretrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, onlythose fragments which are explicit in the cipher arereadily detected.  To allow a completely generalspecification of fragments it seems inevitable that adetailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the queryand library structures.  A technique for making such detailedcomparisons is presented in this report.  This techniqueis novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking adrestarting required by other atom-by-atom matchingprocedures.Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,some definitions are reviewed and a brief example ispresented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flowdiagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additionalexamples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm fora digital computer is discussed.This report is a condensed version of the original, whichgives a generalization and comprehensive description ofthe algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.",

    "author": "Zadeh, L. A.",
    "words": "A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very,more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operatorwhich acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. Forexample, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very actson the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define severalelementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations maybe built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximaterepresentation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations ascomplementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrastintensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I,e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximatedby an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II,e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge ismore  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the componentsof its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedgerequires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of itsoperand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether itfalls into category I or II..The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations forseveral relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly,etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent,require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is morequalitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..",

By the following year test resultscoming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II madefurther modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forwardto read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence ofsubsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expecteddecreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the resultsof a number of different searches are averaged.

It is shown that only fourbasic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, andcausation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in alinear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutationsof such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement ofthe first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then beconstructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..The nature of possible classifications is discussed..

As a result a rapid andlarge increase has taken place in the research activity in this field andbiophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. Theconsequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created greatdifficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. Tocope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicalsin this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual reviewof biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect theimpact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accuratelythan the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out thepredominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific efforttoday, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemicalmethodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation tosize of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has beendeveloped and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters whichshould be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal inrelation to the number of paper published, compactness of the informationcontent, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness ofpresentation..The results of the present study have been discussed in relation toBradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested,namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in ascientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear inincreasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected thatthe present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workersin the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of theirsignificance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..",

Originally it was considered that to meetthese two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems,and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesisthat a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different froma 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this formfor some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recalland precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of therelevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But-Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.",

It has been found thatall the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though theybelong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes..In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected fromappropriate schedules..

The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" asit is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a givencollection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, whichfunction most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or thosewhich are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experimentand uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied bynonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated usingthe Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as theusual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine thestatistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the\"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a fewdocuments are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are moreeffective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documentsare wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made forthe quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision neverimproves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. Acorollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the sameaverage breadth where one indexing consists ofsemantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and theother consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest thattitle-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..",

In thecourse of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, thepresence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are notvalid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore,using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials..Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished,that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship,including compilations and works produced under editorial direction..

Faced at CentralMethodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown itscabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinionwas undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should beconsidered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because ofinconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filingof subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all usersof the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks:1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject?Were you looking under author, title, or subject?2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog?3.

The causes for being unaware of costsmay stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to theprofession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of costaccounting. What is suspected is a lack of the fewsimple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, inshort - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis.In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their relatedprocedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with successover the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents thefindings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements ofyour own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediaterequirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in thesix steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition toidentifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis,these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningfulfor your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future.",

We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by morethan thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subjectof the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably somedivisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, thegreatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of theliterature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the yearin which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.",

The order department, whichin university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was notconsidered to be of comparable importance with the major department --the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions wouldbe concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers orofficial documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largelyautonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staffwere mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and inanswering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections,especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with thegeneral bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-dayreference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to becomeexpert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any partin the activities of another.. Divisions between the variouskinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library'sorganization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that thisis a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach.Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freezethe administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject fieldoften undertook research in the subject outside the library and mightoccasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of hisfield, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connectionwith his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer,orientalist or linguist.The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a completere-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyondthe bounds of the old departments.",

The amountof instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficienciesof the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined interms of the values of the objectives.\tThe amounts of instruction andmotivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing theamounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function ofthe amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount ofmotivation in the state.

Comparative analyses relating project rankingsproduced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitabilityindex and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance ofthe scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the developmentof the model.

In effect,since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated uponthe examination of one \"level of processing\" of the document (e.g., thecitation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the propertiesof what constitutes \"relevance\".  However, prior to such an analysis, aneven more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portionsof a document should be examined.An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs),functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predictthe relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documentsby motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlledexperimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediateresponse products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph,last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would berepresentative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation andabstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that:1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatmentgroups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which matchthe subsequent user relevancy decision on the document;2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predictedrelevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs;3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was notsubstantive.Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previouswork with unmotivated subjects.",

Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, atone time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how theirparticular science has reached its present state and what will be the course ofits future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance toscientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in theirown right.Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spreadwithin a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and cantherefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set ofmathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature ofscientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible toestablish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given areaof scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing linesof investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within thegiven area.The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying itto the development of knowledge about mast cells.

Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited inthe Journal of Ecology three or more times in1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles inthe two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear inboth.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year,only eight (25%) attained that level in both, andtwelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rankcorrelation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the dataanalyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are validparameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is nomention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from theearlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in whichanalyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed interms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger havediscussed the difference between citations in one article and future citationsto that article.  Their work implies a more complexrelation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity ofcitations for forecasting library consultationsremains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is notnecessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is oftenintended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again,each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most ofwhich he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there anyinherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles betweenthe list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers.",

Forexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have oneentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plusthe record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.

(In MasterControl, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded oneither side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma,colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode thedata element is compared with the profile word, character bycharacter, which results in a prohibitively time-consumingprocess for large data bases.We chose the inverted-table technique because of the largeamount of data to be searched.  Individual tables wereconstructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, andtitles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlledby the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions hadto be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of thequestions had actually been submitted by other members of thestaff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDIbasis.

The basicweaknesses of these libraries fall into fourcategories: inadequate collections, inadequatepersonnel, inadequate space, and the absence ofany practical indexing system to facilitate use ofcollections that do exist.Failure to deal with these problems does notreflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulationto do so and absence of any concerted source ofguidance.

Twoforces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subjectindexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers;secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchangenetworks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field ofsubject indexing.

This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.

A difficultyin this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likelyto yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonablelimits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, andeven so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has beenplaced on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this isconsidered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and hasnot, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance,but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval ofnon-relevant references.

Thepresent note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo'sassertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was astandard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first,challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as aKuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorismis in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons forthis.",

    "words": "A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theoryof information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and hasexpanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a verypractical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is itpossible to define the quantity of information contained in a message ortelegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of informationcommunicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare thesetwo qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of theseproblems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunicationengineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematicaland practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations.Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientificdiscussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and toshow a very direct connection between information and entropy.  Thethermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certainphysical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory,it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principlestates that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger thanthe amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negativeentropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  Thegeneralized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle ofinformation.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experimentsand is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.",

This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one ofpsychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: JeanPiaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that heis hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades beendeveloping a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of thedevelopment of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhnacknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits asequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.",

Those historians and philosophers of science who express thispoint of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integralpart of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop apyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists..An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsiblefor advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most ofthe eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and NationalAcademy members of today, are the \"pedestrians\" of history..This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for thefield of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawnfrom a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second froma subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a thirdfrom a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of dataindicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published byvarious types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that thephysicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on theresearch produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implicationsof these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areasfor necessary future research are suggested..",

It deals with abstract configurationscalled digraphs, which consist of \"points\" and \"directed lines.\"  Whenthese terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematicalmodels of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflectstructural properties of the empirical world.  Since the same mathematicalterms can be given a variety of empirical meanings, digraph theory hasapplicability to many different fields of investigation.",

Precisely constructed modelsfor linguistic structure can play an important role, both negativeand positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precisebut inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we canoften expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently,gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.

The data describe instances in which respondents acquired usefultechnical information from sources outside their immediate circle ofcolleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functionalapproach in which the use of various means of information transfer isconsidered in relation to the purposes of technical work..While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of thissort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means willvary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report exploresthe association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational,and technological factors with variations in the use of sources ofinformation.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, thosevariations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which theinformation was applied..The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions,one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some bodyof systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operationalobjectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informalsources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and moredistant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on\"professional\" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge..In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have,within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the needfor managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay inthis process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formaland social groups..

Only 40 participantscould be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number offaculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10,economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3..An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into bothLibrary of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject headingterms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash,parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OFbecomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting\"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching withsubject headings and class numbers..The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARCrecords.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6..Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that thesum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less thanthe hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of aparticular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that ahit would occur on any matching number..Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. ProgramExtract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number(accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for currentrecords; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those inthe profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print comparedthese card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copiesof each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the facultymember's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be usedfor making recommendations to the library..Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC filemainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record,whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record'ssecond or third heading..The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selectingrelevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to thefaculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic,regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works totheir attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items theyotherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in allbut only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided aconvenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased theamount of recommending done..

Two aspects to be considered in designing a storagesystem are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and thecriteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This studydemonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storagequantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and thesmall shelving costs associated with stored materials..Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and theother utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost criticalage at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines thefraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that thecirculation rate of the books decline with age according to an averagegeometric pattern of obsolescence..The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books isutilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decisionvariable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usagerate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time thata book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without beingused.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for whichthe time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence,although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the compositedistribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends uponthe circulation activities of the individual libraries..An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collectedfrom three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parametersextracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rulesand the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized fromstorage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of thecollection must be stored..Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that thelatter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situationwhere the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unitrelocation cost..Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of valuesshow that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relativelyinsignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in thecapacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results;and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation costdifferential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rathersubjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have apotentially large influence on the decision rules..",

    "words": "Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research..Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the majorresponsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Mostuniversities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specializedlibraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. Thisuse of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally,resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines..The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that thisdivision of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular toexamine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and thescattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns..These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of librarysystems..Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actuallyestimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data aredeveloped.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has itsadvantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually maderelative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines canbe defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which canserve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines..This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline andalso for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the studyof journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"titledispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which hasresulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradforddistribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from varioussources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly theYule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, andevaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use indetermining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of addingadditional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, andbuilding mathematical models of library systems are among some of theapplications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivityfunctions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system asa function of the number of subscriptions it receives..The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to whichthe above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data wascollected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D.dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Completerecords of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained..The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generallysatisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientificdisciplines is measured as is the similaritybetween the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is alsomeasured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system'sholdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposedand evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such conceptsas title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity betweendisciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basisfor the design and evaluation of complete library systems..",

The more critical ofthese problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability,storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problemsis presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility andadvantages..The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posterioriautomatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility isdemonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 documentdescriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated byestablishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems andapplying these measures to a number of different classification strategies..By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual andone automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon theindexing method used..It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied,one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. Inaddition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at leastas good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, asthe a priori, manual classification system currently in use with theaforementioned file..The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying afile of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are includedas an appendix to this dissertation..",

As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out theirpresent collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain andjustify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for \"weedingwithout tears.\"3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal withthe acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is oneof the best techniques available for the long-range building of usefulcollections.4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped thatlibraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costsof weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount ofcirculation and in user satisfaction.",

    "words": "A characteristic of inventory in business or industryis that approximately 80 percent of the number oftransactions taken from a warehouse represents about20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also beconsidered as a ranking of stock items by theirtransaction activity which will show that the top 20percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most activeitems) account for about 80 percent of the totalnumber of transactions.  The rule is sometimesexpressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100as the phenomena relate to the relationships betweenthe two statistical measures.",

Its basic idea is to useletter symbols to denote functional groups and to use numbersto express the lengths of alkyl chains and the sizes of rings.These symbols then are cited in connecting order from one end ofthe molecule to the other.  For the past hundred years, eversince structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphicsymbols in this way.  This line-formula notation is simply anextension and standardization of this practice.",

I was impressed bythe large amount of research being conducted in the field, but foundthe task of integrating that research and of identifying the progressmade during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part,this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigatorsin the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they usedto study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparenttheoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to behighly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardizationof terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processesunderlying empirical data.",

In the Motivation toWork that followed, we described an original researchstudy that offered a completely new hypothesis about theway people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I havetaken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theoryof Work and the Nature of Man.\tWhile the trilogy containsthe three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledgeof what has gone before, new research and finally atheory, the task that I set out for myself many yearsago, upon graduation for the School of Public Healthat the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning.That task was to give original substance to the newdiscipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible,to make some positive contributions.",

But it seems fair to observethat most of the activity has been addressed to separate facetsof the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the manyactions and forces are affecting one another to produce the totalconsequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are comingto believe that the interactions within the whole are more importantthan the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as onestep toward showing how the behavior of the world system results frommutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agriculturalsubsystems.",

Theintention of the present work is to examine some of theimplications of this rapid growth in the number of libraryschools, noting current trends and possible changes in thefuture.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed,and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo-American library education, while at the same time examiningother major patterns of professional education for librarianswhich exist in the world, and comparing these with theapproach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt hasbeen made to trace the influences which the British andAmerica systems of library education have had, particularlyin the developing countries.",

In furtherance of aconstitutionally recognized goal - \"To promote the Progress ofScience and the useful Arts\" - Congress has thus adopted aconstitutionally authorized means - \"securing...to Inventorsthe exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries.\"  Theconstitutional clause is remarkable in several respects.  Itsrecognition of the possibility that invention might requireencouragement implies not only that technological innovation isdesirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantityof innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum.This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which thetendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activitieswas greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiryinto the soundness of the supposition.",
