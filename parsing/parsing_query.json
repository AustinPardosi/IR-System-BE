To evaluate theeffect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measuresof similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved.Papers were then sorted by the similarity measures, producing two orderedlists.  We then compared the resulting predictions of relevance, partialrelevance, and non-relevance to the user's evaluations of the same papers.Overall, the change from the bibliographic coupling measure to the linkagesimilarity measure, representing the introduction of cocitation data,resulted in better retrieval performance.",

In this paper aprobabilistic model of cluster searching  based on query classification isdescribed.  This model is tested with retrieval experiments which indicatethat it can be more effective than heuristic cluster searches and clustersearches based on other models.  It can also be more effective than a fullsearch in which every document is compared to the query.  The efficiencyaspects of the implementation of the model are discussed.",

During the \"training\" phase, words frompre-classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrenceof each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a referencedictionary.  The \"classification\" phase matches each word of a documenttitle against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the documentusing weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristictechniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, pasttenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classificationphase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis ofchemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influencethe section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance andhuman consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program resultsagainst the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment withpeople experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.  Theprogram assigned approximately 78% of the documents to the correct majorsection groupings of CA and 67% of the correct sections or cross-referencesat a rate of 100 documents per second.",

As with many rallying cries, the term isnot well defined.  For some writers, DSS simply mean interactive systemsfor use by managers.  To others, the key issue is support, rather thansystem.  They focus on understanding and improving the decision process;a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Someresearchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as anextension of Management Science techniques.  The former define DecisionSupport as providing managers with access to data and the latter as givingthem access to analytic models.The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant tosituations where a \"final\" system can be developed only through anadaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy mustthen focus on getting finished; this is very different from ManagementScience and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSScenter around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learningrepresentation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture andstrategies for getting started.",

Thescientists served by these systems are often members of what have been calledinvisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication withone another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Oftensuch groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regardingthis subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identifyparadigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalizethe notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.'Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Alreadyknowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages inwhich certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, wemight find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of thepapers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A'and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner.Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authorscombining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though somepredominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure isgiven by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken fromtwo to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occursin the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensusregarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  Forconcepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph withconcepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs)connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure issimilar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that inour approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.",

In conventional retrievalenvironments parallel list processing and parallel search facilities are ofgreatest interest.  In more advanced systems, the use of array processorsalso proves beneficial.  Various information retrieval processes are examinedand evidence is given to demonstrate the usefulness of parallel processingand fast computational facilities in information retrieval.",

    "words": "The frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collectionhave been used as indicators of term importance for content analysis andindexing purposes.  In particular, very rare or very frequent terms arenormally believed to be less effective than medium-frequency terms.  Recentlyautomatic indexing theories have been devised that use not only the termfrequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of the terms.The major term-weighting theories are first briefly reviewed.  The termprecision and term utility weights that are based on the occurrencecharacteristics of the terms in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant,documents of a collection are then introduced.  Methods are suggested forestimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their overalloccurrence characteristics in the collection.  Finally, experimentalevaluation results are shown comparing the weighting systems using the termrelevance properties with the more conventional frequency-based methodologies.",

Effectivenessis measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are doneon three different test collections.",

Primaryinformation is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposedto secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, atable of contents, or an index.Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicitedfrom specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, alongwith four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the variousfeatures of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simpleword occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval resultsagainst types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrievalperformances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expectedsearch length reduction factors.Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did notperform significantly better than the other systems.",

The analysis assumes that the more two authorsare cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw dataare cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social SciencesCitation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows(1) identifiable author groups (akin to \"schools\") of information science,(2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree ofcentrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities ofauthors within group and across group boundaries (\"border authors\" who seemto connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors withrespect to the map's axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the mostdivergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis ofauthors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding ofintellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to theextent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The techniqueestablishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit inanalyzing subject specialties.",
