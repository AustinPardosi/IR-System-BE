This, be it noted, is most evident infiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the packis virtually impossible and where co-operation without fightingis necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbiallypeaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and oftenfatal attacks on the weaker mate.In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how inthe human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, andnot guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, theaggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found inanimals.

    "words": "As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the sciencestudying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particularsystem of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelmingmajority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraicstructures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The firstgeneral theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitraryoperations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basicprinciples of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Suchsets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory madeabundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility ofmaking fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras butalso the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory wasdiscovered by the author in 1936.During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that thetheory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimatelyrelated despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  Andit is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systemsdealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations andrelations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is thelanguage of the so-called applied predicate calculus.

    "words": "Recently a number of articles, books, and reportsdealing with information systems, i.e., document retrievalsystems, have advanced the doctrine that such systemsare to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentageof relevancy they provide.Although there seems to be little agreement on whatrelevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixedand formal relationship exists between the relevance andthe recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will findin the literature both a frankly subjective notion ofrelevance as reported by individual users, and equations,curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably providenumerical measures of the recall and relevancecharacteristics of information systems.  This phenomenonof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjectiveand non-mathematical term to equations in which thesame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematicaldefinition has its ancient parallel in discussionsof probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate themeaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,on \"who is master,\" the user or the term.  On the other hand,the use of a single term in the same document to covertwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such ausage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrineby attributing to it mathematical validity which it doesnot have, represents a more serious situation than merelycareless ambiguity..X468\t2\t28486\t2\t28486\t2\t28487\t2\t28514\t2\t28518\t2\t28564\t2\t28565\t2\t28565\t2\t28595\t2\t28615\t2\t28646\t2\t28661\t2\t28663\t2\t2828\t2\t2828\t2\t2828\t2\t2828\t2\t2828\t2\t2842\t2\t2843\t2\t2845\t2\t28714\t2\t28752\t2\t28785\t2\t2872\t2\t2879\t2\t28820\t2\t28822\t2\t28827\t2\t28829\t2\t28853\t2\t28895\t2\t28133\t2\t28134\t2\t28157\t2\t281091\t2\t281282\t2\t28381\t2\t28389\t2\t28390\t2\t28",

Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicatesthat the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements..

By providing some additional information, beyondthe minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, acitation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long listthose citing references which are most relevant to his immediate searchrequirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particularattention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citationentries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publicationis operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral featureof the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships ofpotential value to users of science literature is presented.. Theserelationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature..

Author indexing of285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms thatwas  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the samedocument.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. Theaverage author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more thanone member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, ascompared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method andcriterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexingderived from document titles..

Complete ordering in this manner may not befeasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in searchzones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relativeefficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zonesizes under an assumed target distribution pattern..

Questions were collected from eyeresearchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine differentsecondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent tothe eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eyeresearch interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small numberof journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eyeresearchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreignlanguages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of morethan 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and themailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to theresearchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospectivesearches more than one secondary service must be used..

This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in responseto a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred(\"answer-providing documents\").. \"Answer can be inferred from document\" hasmany possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an \"inferencespecification\").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about thecorrectness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc.,any inference specification can only approximate scientific inferencepractices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inferencepractices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occursin a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with someapparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact isdescribed which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for aquestion.. However, because the indexing is \"nonrelational\", it could causefalse retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievalsare   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data forhelping selection among them..

A probability model of expecteddistribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particularsequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On theassumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of theircontributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than otherscientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesseoblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as theireminence grows..

    "title": "Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries",

    "words": "The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognitionfor a particular scientific contribution depending on theirlocation in the stratification system.  Merton originally introducedthe concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors ofmultiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept isgeneralized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effectwere to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should beinfluenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies ofsimilar design.  In each study we control for the number of citationspapers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups ofpapers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.We then see whether there were any differences in the reception ofthese papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author'slocation in the stratification system.  All the data indicatethat assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more importantdeterminant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratificationvariables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal qualityis influenced by the reputation of the author based on past workthat is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  TheMatthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigiouspoints of the social system of science.  All other stratificationvariables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awardsdid not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented thatindicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are nomore likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focusattention on the work of little-known men who collaborate withscientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibilityof the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussionis included of the relevance of these data for the study ofresistance to scientific discoveries..X544\t2\t89544\t2\t89545\t2\t89552\t2\t89552\t2\t89560\t2\t89560\t2\t89560\t2\t89582\t2\t89587\t2\t89589\t2\t89602\t2\t89605\t2\t89613\t2\t89614\t2\t89632\t2\t89638\t2\t89656\t2\t89685\t2\t8933\t2\t8936\t2\t8939\t2\t8941\t2\t89722\t2\t89735\t2\t89735\t2\t89735\t2\t89747\t2\t89750\t2\t89753\t2\t89766\t2\t89766\t2\t89767\t2\t89775\t2\t89782\t2\t89784\t2\t89784\t2\t89784\t2\t89784\t2\t89788\t2\t89789\t2\t89793\t2\t8976\t2\t8988\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8989\t2\t8997\t2\t8998\t2\t89800\t2\t89808\t2\t89828\t2\t89100\t2\t89102\t2\t89102\t2\t89102\t2\t89102\t2\t89105\t2\t89105\t2\t89105\t2\t89107\t2\t89109\t2\t89110\t2\t89111\t2\t89111\t2\t89112\t2\t89113\t2\t89113\t2\t89113\t2\t89155\t2\t89157\t2\t89163\t2\t89183\t2\t89183\t2\t89184\t2\t89184\t2\t89193\t2\t89193\t2\t89198\t2\t89199\t2\t89905\t2\t89953\t2\t89977\t2\t89983\t2\t89201\t2\t89203\t2\t89204\t2\t89210\t2\t89225\t2\t89269\t2\t891016\t2\t891023\t2\t891030\t2\t891030\t2\t891050\t2\t891050\t2\t891055\t2\t891055\t2\t891062\t2\t891062\t2\t891083\t2\t891085\t2\t891087\t2\t891090\t2\t891135\t2\t891256\t2\t891256\t2\t891260\t2\t891273\t2\t891275\t2\t891275\t2\t891276\t2\t891278\t2\t891280\t2\t891280\t2\t891283\t2\t891284\t2\t891285\t2\t891285\t2\t891285\t2\t891285\t2\t891286\t2\t891287\t2\t891287\t2\t891290\t2\t891291\t2\t891291\t2\t891291\t2\t891293\t2\t891294\t2\t891295\t2\t891296\t2\t891296\t2\t891296\t2\t891297\t2\t891300\t2\t891301\t2\t891302\t2\t891302\t2\t891302\t2\t891302\t2\t891319\t2\t891335\t2\t891339\t2\t891341\t2\t891346\t2\t891346\t2\t891346\t2\t891346\t2\t891347\t2\t891386\t2\t891386\t2\t891386\t2\t891387\t2\t891390\t2\t891397\t2\t891397\t2\t891417\t2\t891428\t2\t891432\t2\t891432\t2\t891444\t2\t89308\t2\t89312\t2\t89314\t2\t89356\t2\t89356\t2\t89359\t2\t89373\t2\t89384\t2\t89391\t2\t89",

In classical librarianship noeffort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement ofvolumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except forthat small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, usersremain nameless.The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users asindividual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potentialfor enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities ofwhich classical librarianship has deprived them since their days asone-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the onlycontribution computerization will make to libraries.Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish newobjectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenonthat is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small speciallibraries already do, all libraries must participate in the culturalactivities of the individuals in their communities rather thanmerely make available a torpid \"service.\" Libraries must look forward tosupplying information to a user when and where he needs it - anobjective impossible to attain with classical library techniques..X5\t2\t90435\t2\t90543\t2\t90553\t2\t90588\t2\t90608\t2\t90610\t2\t90612\t2\t90613\t2\t90615\t2\t90617\t2\t90617\t2\t90620\t2\t90620\t2\t90624\t2\t9033\t2\t9036\t2\t90799\t2\t9090\t2\t9090\t2\t9090\t2\t9090\t2\t9090\t2\t9090\t2\t9090\t2\t9091\t2\t90800\t2\t90808\t2\t90815\t2\t90815\t2\t90868\t2\t90868\t2\t90869\t2\t90872\t2\t90897\t2\t90158\t2\t90161\t2\t90183\t2\t90184\t2\t90193\t2\t90199\t2\t90938\t2\t90939\t2\t90957\t2\t90959\t2\t90963\t2\t90990\t2\t90991\t2\t90992\t2\t90201\t2\t90202\t2\t90203\t2\t90204\t2\t90205\t2\t90209\t2\t90212\t2\t90217\t2\t90220\t2\t90222\t2\t90222\t2\t90223\t2\t90231\t2\t90261\t2\t90284\t2\t90286\t2\t90289\t2\t90294\t2\t90294\t2\t90295\t2\t90299\t2\t901023\t2\t901151\t2\t901196\t2\t901196\t2\t901197\t2\t901219\t2\t901221\t2\t901221\t2\t901227\t2\t901229\t2\t901318\t2\t901365\t2\t901365\t2\t901390\t2\t901390\t2\t90334\t2\t90348\t2\t90354\t2\t90368\t2\t90",

Fromthe knowledge that is available, however, we areled to conclude that the communication patternsin the two areas of activity are not only largelyindependent of one another, but qualitativelydifferent in their nature.  This difference isreflected most clearly in the mechanisms bywhich information is diffused within the twosets of practitioners.

They may even suggestthat somewhere in the process by which socialscientists take note of the world as it isand as it once was, a sense of values appearsto have become badly scrambled..X475\t2\t100544\t2\t100545\t2\t100602\t2\t10048\t2\t10089\t2\t10095\t2\t10098\t2\t100100\t2\t100100\t2\t100100\t2\t100100\t2\t100100\t2\t100100\t2\t100100\t2\t100102\t2\t100106\t2\t100107\t2\t100107\t2\t100108\t2\t100111\t2\t100113\t2\t1001062\t2\t1001083\t2\t1001085\t2\t1001187\t2\t1001285\t2\t1001288\t2\t1001291\t2\t1001296\t2\t1001300\t2\t1001301\t2\t1001302\t2\t1001312\t2\t1001313\t2\t1001337\t2\t1001338\t2\t1001345\t2\t1001386\t2\t1001386\t2\t1001386\t2\t100314\t2\t100343\t2\t100359\t2\t100386\t2\t100",

Therefore, thenew idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a newfield; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, thisoccurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as apositive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, itis shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoringthe mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, andfrom the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and itsconsequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study ofthe human mind into an experimental science...X544\t2\t101560\t2\t101605\t2\t101667\t2\t10133\t2\t101750\t2\t101775\t2\t10188\t2\t101800\t2\t101101\t2\t101101\t2\t101101\t2\t101101\t2\t101101\t2\t101101\t2\t101102\t2\t101102\t2\t101105\t2\t1011063\t2\t1011063\t2\t1011081\t2\t1011082\t2\t1011088\t2\t1011271\t2\t1011285\t2\t1011286\t2\t1011287\t2\t1011308\t2\t1011310\t2\t1011312\t2\t1011320\t2\t1011334\t2\t1011334\t2\t1011386\t2\t1011387\t2\t101343\t2\t101343\t2\t101391\t2\t101",

Because of feedbackthrough recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain orincrease their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produceeven less later on..

Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis forchemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases ininequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated witha changing distribution of time spent on research..

    "author": "Cole, S.",
    "words": "The Problem of assessing the \"quality\" of scientificpublications has long been a major impediment toprogress in the sociology of science.  Most researchershave typically paid homage to the belief that quantity ofoutput is not the equivalent of quality and have then goneahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemedto be no practicable way to measure the quality of largenumbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers ofscientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable toolto measure the significance of individual scientists'contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed allbibliographic references appearing in an increasingly largenumber of journals.  The number of citations anindividual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicatorof the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of thatindividual's publications..X456\t2\t113487\t2\t113503\t2\t113513\t2\t113544\t2\t113545\t2\t113545\t2\t113545\t2\t113545\t2\t113560\t2\t113560\t2\t113560\t2\t113592\t2\t113602\t2\t113605\t2\t113607\t2\t113632\t2\t11339\t2\t11347\t2\t11348\t2\t11348\t2\t11348\t2\t11348\t2\t113764\t2\t113784\t2\t113793\t2\t113793\t2\t11388\t2\t11389\t2\t11389\t2\t11389\t2\t113100\t2\t113102\t2\t113102\t2\t113102\t2\t113102\t2\t113102\t2\t113102\t2\t113102\t2\t113103\t2\t113104\t2\t113104\t2\t113105\t2\t113105\t2\t113106\t2\t113106\t2\t113106\t2\t113107\t2\t113108\t2\t113108\t2\t113110\t2\t113110\t2\t113111\t2\t113111\t2\t113111\t2\t113111\t2\t113111\t2\t113111\t2\t113112\t2\t113112\t2\t113112\t2\t113112\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113113\t2\t113161\t2\t113163\t2\t113170\t2\t113199\t2\t113911\t2\t113243\t2\t1131030\t2\t1131062\t2\t1131087\t2\t1131210\t2\t1131270\t2\t1131273\t2\t1131273\t2\t1131273\t2\t1131274\t2\t1131274\t2\t1131280\t2\t1131285\t2\t1131285\t2\t1131285\t2\t1131285\t2\t1131287\t2\t1131287\t2\t1131287\t2\t1131291\t2\t1131291\t2\t1131291\t2\t1131293\t2\t1131296\t2\t1131298\t2\t1131300\t2\t1131300\t2\t1131300\t2\t1131301\t2\t1131302\t2\t1131302\t2\t1131302\t2\t1131304\t2\t1131304\t2\t1131308\t2\t1131312\t2\t1131313\t2\t1131313\t2\t1131313\t2\t1131315\t2\t1131335\t2\t1131335\t2\t1131337\t2\t1131337\t2\t1131338\t2\t1131338\t2\t1131338\t2\t1131341\t2\t1131341\t2\t1131340\t2\t1131344\t2\t1131344\t2\t1131344\t2\t1131345\t2\t1131346\t2\t1131346\t2\t1131346\t2\t1131346\t2\t1131346\t2\t1131347\t2\t1131347\t2\t1131347\t2\t1131347\t2\t1131386\t2\t1131386\t2\t1131444\t2\t113312\t2\t113314\t2\t113314\t2\t113356\t2\t113356\t2\t113360\t2\t113",

This chapter attemptsto continue enlarging our perception of the range of reportedactivities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in whichour readers are chiefly interested..X459\t2\t120506\t2\t120575\t2\t120584\t2\t120599\t2\t120621\t2\t120630\t2\t120634\t2\t120692\t2\t120696\t2\t12039\t2\t120705\t2\t120736\t2\t120795\t2\t12067\t2\t12083\t2\t120826\t2\t120120\t2\t120120\t2\t120120\t2\t120120\t2\t120120\t2\t120120\t2\t120128\t2\t120135\t2\t120135\t2\t120139\t2\t120172\t2\t120197\t2\t120907\t2\t120925\t2\t120244\t2\t120245\t2\t120291\t2\t120292\t2\t1201038\t2\t1201101\t2\t1201178\t2\t1201187\t2\t1201402\t2\t1201426\t2\t120382\t2\t120",

While we may call ourselves librarians, informationscientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists,IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have onething in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in thedissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interestedin far more than the techniques for transmission of information fromone point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that \"themedium is the message,\" we must concern ourselves with not only themeans of document dissemination, but also the content and value ofthe documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughoutmost of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator shouldthink of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data,evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controllingtheir transmission to a target: the reader..X465\t2\t121466\t2\t121541\t2\t12113\t2\t12118\t2\t121720\t2\t12176\t2\t121873\t2\t121881\t2\t121121\t2\t121121\t2\t121121\t2\t121121\t2\t121121\t2\t121125\t2\t121127\t2\t121129\t2\t121145\t2\t121914\t2\t121919\t2\t121920\t2\t121921\t2\t121201\t2\t121213\t2\t1211143\t2\t1211362\t2\t1211363\t2\t1211363\t2\t1211441\t2\t121",

Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movementtoward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data basesis not very strong, and it will probably not be many years beforesatisfying experience with this new mode of information access willhelp it become not merely an experimental innovation but thestandard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspectsof the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactivesystems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, andBrandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and disseminationsystems.This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentiallygreat importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, inthe coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction ofsome of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to definethe potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other newareas of interest are information system applications in the criminaljustice system and information system applications in the humanities.In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areasof information science, which we attempt to review on as close to anannual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document descriptionand representation, and organization of information.

    "words": "The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning andservices are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Reviewchapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishmentof many new library consortia, and there were some tentative effortsto use computers for nationwide bibliographic information \"utilities.\"These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of beingcost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not onlypromises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses newproblems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutionsrequires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importanceto a clear understanding of the information needs of specific usersubgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planningand design, including intelligent consideration of the \"make versus buy\"issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems andconsiderations.One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growthin the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operatedby the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  Theapparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the sameproblems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation amonglibrary and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printedmaterials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or lessrapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  Theinclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over theownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of thatcontroversy - the role of government and non-profit information servicesin relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year'schapter on document retrieval systems and techniques..X449\t2\t126525\t2\t126526\t2\t126533\t2\t126574\t2\t126616\t2\t126640\t2\t126823\t2\t126126\t2\t126126\t2\t126126\t2\t126126\t2\t126126\t2\t126126\t2\t126126\t2\t126131\t2\t1261035\t2\t1261305\t2\t1261306\t2\t1261313\t2\t126",

Thischapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlierdata base papers not treated in prior chapters.For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be anorganized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographicor document-related data..X432\t2\t127450\t2\t127451\t2\t127452\t2\t127459\t2\t127459\t2\t127459\t2\t127459\t2\t127460\t2\t127461\t2\t127468\t2\t127471\t2\t127484\t2\t127492\t2\t127508\t2\t127511\t2\t127512\t2\t127514\t2\t127518\t2\t127520\t2\t127523\t2\t127524\t2\t127524\t2\t127525\t2\t127525\t2\t127526\t2\t127527\t2\t127529\t2\t127529\t2\t127530\t2\t127530\t2\t127534\t2\t127534\t2\t127546\t2\t127553\t2\t127579\t2\t127580\t2\t127594\t2\t127603\t2\t127604\t2\t127606\t2\t127609\t2\t127610\t2\t127611\t2\t127612\t2\t127622\t2\t127625\t2\t127626\t2\t127630\t2\t127633\t2\t127635\t2\t127636\t2\t127636\t2\t127637\t2\t127637\t2\t127642\t2\t127642\t2\t127642\t2\t127643\t2\t127644\t2\t127645\t2\t127646\t2\t127648\t2\t127649\t2\t127650\t2\t127650\t2\t127692\t2\t127696\t2\t127699\t2\t12718\t2\t12718\t2\t12718\t2\t12718\t2\t127702\t2\t127703\t2\t127703\t2\t127705\t2\t127708\t2\t127708\t2\t127726\t2\t127727\t2\t127728\t2\t127730\t2\t127730\t2\t127731\t2\t127732\t2\t127732\t2\t127733\t2\t127733\t2\t127734\t2\t127734\t2\t127736\t2\t127736\t2\t127736\t2\t127737\t2\t127737\t2\t127738\t2\t127738\t2\t127739\t2\t127739\t2\t127740\t2\t127741\t2\t127741\t2\t127742\t2\t127743\t2\t127744\t2\t127755\t2\t127820\t2\t127826\t2\t127826\t2\t127827\t2\t127827\t2\t127877\t2\t127879\t2\t127879\t2\t127883\t2\t127121\t2\t127124\t2\t127125\t2\t127125\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127127\t2\t127129\t2\t127129\t2\t127129\t2\t127129\t2\t127145\t2\t127145\t2\t127145\t2\t127145\t2\t127190\t2\t127191\t2\t127197\t2\t127211\t2\t127214\t2\t127218\t2\t127243\t2\t1271004\t2\t1271035\t2\t1271078\t2\t1271089\t2\t1271091\t2\t1271143\t2\t1271143\t2\t1271207\t2\t1271227\t2\t1271264\t2\t1271297\t2\t1271303\t2\t1271306\t2\t1271356\t2\t1271364\t2\t1271368\t2\t1271370\t2\t1271370\t2\t1271372\t2\t1271372\t2\t1271373\t2\t1271374\t2\t1271374\t2\t1271375\t2\t1271376\t2\t1271376\t2\t1271377\t2\t1271383\t2\t1271396\t2\t1271396\t2\t1271396\t2\t127307\t2\t127330\t2\t127357\t2\t127363\t2\t127376\t2\t127376\t2\t127378\t2\t127",

    "author": "Swanson, R.W.",
    "words": "The co-joining of \"design\" with \"evaluation\" that is called for by thischapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for theauthor.  In part, \"design\" and \"evaluation\" prescribe two separate setsof activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, andtesting of new information system structures and modification of existingstructures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operationalsystems and system components.  However, \"design\" includes not only theformulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions forevaluation in accordance with expectations.  \"Evaluation\" applies totesting design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementationsfor the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to theappraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of systemoperability may yield data that indicate the need for system modificationsthat require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of \"design\" and\"evaluation\" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated inhis 1969 review.\"Design\" and \"evaluation\" may be examined methodologically or withrespect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence ofoutcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.

Itis therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is preparedin general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applicationsused in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is consideredto be an organized collection of machine-readable records containingbibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).The data bases that we will consider are used for information storageand retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval ordata base generation.The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographicinformation, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Numberis a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such asthat by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic materialis included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, mostof the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in ashipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of thischapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generationof publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that productionoperation..X432\t2\t129450\t2\t129451\t2\t129452\t2\t129459\t2\t129459\t2\t129460\t2\t129461\t2\t129468\t2\t129468\t2\t129469\t2\t129484\t2\t129492\t2\t129494\t2\t129508\t2\t129511\t2\t129512\t2\t129514\t2\t129518\t2\t129520\t2\t129523\t2\t129524\t2\t129525\t2\t129526\t2\t129529\t2\t129530\t2\t129534\t2\t129546\t2\t129553\t2\t129579\t2\t129580\t2\t129585\t2\t129594\t2\t129599\t2\t129603\t2\t129604\t2\t129606\t2\t129609\t2\t129610\t2\t129611\t2\t129612\t2\t129622\t2\t129625\t2\t129626\t2\t129630\t2\t129636\t2\t129637\t2\t129639\t2\t129640\t2\t129642\t2\t129642\t2\t129643\t2\t129644\t2\t129645\t2\t129646\t2\t129646\t2\t129647\t2\t129648\t2\t129649\t2\t129650\t2\t129650\t2\t129651\t2\t129652\t2\t129665\t2\t129692\t2\t129696\t2\t129699\t2\t12918\t2\t12918\t2\t12920\t2\t12942\t2\t129703\t2\t129705\t2\t129708\t2\t129708\t2\t129726\t2\t129727\t2\t129728\t2\t129730\t2\t129731\t2\t129732\t2\t129733\t2\t129734\t2\t129736\t2\t129736\t2\t129737\t2\t129738\t2\t129738\t2\t129739\t2\t129739\t2\t129740\t2\t129741\t2\t129741\t2\t129742\t2\t129743\t2\t129744\t2\t129755\t2\t129762\t2\t129765\t2\t12960\t2\t12985\t2\t129803\t2\t129818\t2\t129820\t2\t129822\t2\t129823\t2\t129826\t2\t129827\t2\t129827\t2\t129879\t2\t129883\t2\t129121\t2\t129124\t2\t129125\t2\t129125\t2\t129127\t2\t129127\t2\t129127\t2\t129127\t2\t129128\t2\t129129\t2\t129129\t2\t129129\t2\t129129\t2\t129129\t2\t129129\t2\t129130\t2\t129145\t2\t129145\t2\t129167\t2\t129172\t2\t129190\t2\t129191\t2\t129197\t2\t129925\t2\t129943\t2\t129944\t2\t129211\t2\t129214\t2\t129218\t2\t129223\t2\t129225\t2\t129234\t2\t129243\t2\t129280\t2\t1291004\t2\t1291022\t2\t1291035\t2\t1291045\t2\t1291070\t2\t1291078\t2\t1291085\t2\t1291089\t2\t1291091\t2\t1291143\t2\t1291143\t2\t1291207\t2\t1291264\t2\t1291268\t2\t1291297\t2\t1291303\t2\t1291356\t2\t1291364\t2\t1291368\t2\t1291370\t2\t1291372\t2\t1291373\t2\t1291374\t2\t1291374\t2\t1291374\t2\t1291375\t2\t1291376\t2\t1291376\t2\t1291377\t2\t1291390\t2\t1291396\t2\t1291401\t2\t1291437\t2\t129307\t2\t129330\t2\t129363\t2\t129376\t2\t129378\t2\t129393\t2\t129",

    "author": "Cuadra, C.A.",
    "words": "Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiryhas begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as \"InformationScience and Technology,\" draws on fragments and fringes of a numberof sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The elementthat provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is ashared deep concern with \"information\" - its generation, transformation,communication, storage, retrieval, and use.Because of the universality of information processes, and also becauseof the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is verylittle agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put itsimply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understoodfield of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,even clear agreement on what the word \"information\" itself means andparticularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or acommodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they neednot and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interestto users, designers, and students of information systems and services.The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,is to provide such a review..X456\t2\t131634\t2\t13140\t2\t131769\t2\t13150\t2\t13150\t2\t131780\t2\t131785\t2\t131791\t2\t13196\t2\t131804\t2\t131114\t2\t131123\t2\t131126\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131131\t2\t131133\t2\t131133\t2\t131133\t2\t131133\t2\t131133\t2\t131133\t2\t131136\t2\t131136\t2\t131136\t2\t131136\t2\t131136\t2\t131138\t2\t131138\t2\t131138\t2\t131140\t2\t131140\t2\t131140\t2\t131144\t2\t131175\t2\t131175\t2\t131175\t2\t131907\t2\t131965\t2\t131966\t2\t131206\t2\t131207\t2\t1311019\t2\t1311035\t2\t1311037\t2\t1311083\t2\t1311255\t2\t1311321\t2\t1311327\t2\t131311\t2\t131359\t2\t131359\t2\t131382\t2\t131395\t2\t131",

Forthis first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies thatmade their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give thereader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of researchhas witnessed progress along the following lines:Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful applicationof a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance inthis field earlier in less rigorous forms;The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solutiondevelopment records; comparison of research teams working on identicaltasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before;andAn increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of theinformation-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [AmericanPsychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of researchin this area..X2\t2\t132475\t2\t132552\t2\t132655\t2\t13214\t2\t13241\t2\t132760\t2\t132767\t2\t132771\t2\t132772\t2\t132772\t2\t132774\t2\t132775\t2\t132783\t2\t132788\t2\t132789\t2\t13276\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132132\t2\t132137\t2\t132137\t2\t132137\t2\t132137\t2\t132137\t2\t132139\t2\t132139\t2\t132147\t2\t132152\t2\t132155\t2\t132161\t2\t132183\t2\t132195\t2\t132952\t2\t132965\t2\t132977\t2\t132202\t2\t132203\t2\t132204\t2\t132210\t2\t132237\t2\t132272\t2\t132274\t2\t132276\t2\t1321030\t2\t1321055\t2\t1321056\t2\t1321095\t2\t1321102\t2\t1321111\t2\t1321275\t2\t1321280\t2\t1321321\t2\t1321445\t2\t1321446\t2\t1321447\t2\t1321451\t2\t132",

    "words": "A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate andrecord knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay tosatellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recordedknowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for thispurpose.The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress isconstantly being elevated as more and more information is presented.Without information and its necessary control, a society is not onlystagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlledby archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future itis destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archivescontained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nationsgrew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of acountry's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives andlibraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information tosucceeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In thisway, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and passthis memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutionscontain the written and graphic record of social memory and humanheritage and provide society with information on which to base actions,develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain..X142\t2\t142142\t2\t142142\t2\t142142\t2\t142142\t2\t1421064\t2\t142",

Questionnaires were sent to all memberorganizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sentto individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI.Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in1976.

Thesethree sources differ in their scope and methods, but share thesame ultimate objective of providing a computer-based currentawareness service.CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides onlyauthors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited bybreaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds withbiological systems, but provides abstracts which are available forcomputer search.  The computer can also search for molecularformulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of allcompounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original formwas based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list ofreferences to older work, and the output is then a list of new papersciting this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', whichis a search for words in the titles of current papers and is thereforeanalogous to a CT search.This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained sofar with these three services, and the potential use of systems ofthis type..X429\t2\t150465\t2\t150465\t2\t150480\t2\t150510\t2\t150510\t2\t150582\t2\t150582\t2\t150589\t2\t150589\t2\t150589\t2\t150589\t2\t150603\t2\t150603\t2\t150603\t2\t150660\t2\t150660\t2\t150662\t2\t150682\t2\t150681\t2\t15038\t2\t15038\t2\t15040\t2\t150704\t2\t150711\t2\t150714\t2\t150716\t2\t150717\t2\t150722\t2\t150722\t2\t150726\t2\t15053\t2\t15052\t2\t15052\t2\t15054\t2\t150782\t2\t150807\t2\t150810\t2\t150813\t2\t150820\t2\t150830\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t150150\t2\t1501089\t2\t1501144\t2\t1501151\t2\t1501195\t2\t1501195\t2\t1501195\t2\t1501281\t2\t1501421\t2\t1501448\t2\t150319\t2\t150347\t2\t150371\t2\t150",

Parallel researchin the business management area and also supported by OSTI is beingconducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School ofBusiness Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in theconstruction of a faceted classification scheme for management,this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizingfaceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.A study of existing information retrieval systems in themanagement field has already been made, so a decision to adoptsome form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparativestudy of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has alsoalready been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfieldresults that appear to provide evidence of the superiority ofnatural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarilybecause these results were restricted to tests on an aeronauticalcollection, and it may well be that the natural language of thisdiscipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which iscertainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language ofmanagement.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, whoquotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organicchemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and socialscience (20 per cent).Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipmentavailable to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest..X454\t2\t151477\t2\t151501\t2\t151501\t2\t151504\t2\t151504\t2\t151504\t2\t151653\t2\t151773\t2\t151781\t2\t151798\t2\t151798\t2\t151802\t2\t151148\t2\t151151\t2\t151151\t2\t151151\t2\t151151\t2\t151151\t2\t151151\t2\t1511118\t2\t1511118\t2\t1511122\t2\t1511123\t2\t1511133\t2\t1511141\t2\t1511163\t2\t1511175\t2\t1511226\t2\t151",

A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively becauseof the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used todescribe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developinga costing method of widespread application would be the establishment ofstandard conventions for the analysis of information systems.One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs forthese systems, namely:(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of informationsystems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysedfor correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in anattempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affectingthem.In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the productionof current-awareness bulletins.

In such research, and really in any good research, one shouldnot be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors areeliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageableproportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort ofhypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtainingevidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise justthat crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence uponwhich to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, oneis ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in afully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or humansituation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this doesnot alter the general methodology.

Althoughan increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe andin the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the reviewconsiders mainly British and American investigations..X433\t2\t161445\t2\t161454\t2\t161470\t2\t161472\t2\t161503\t2\t161506\t2\t161507\t2\t161543\t2\t161545\t2\t161554\t2\t161560\t2\t161560\t2\t161579\t2\t161582\t2\t161584\t2\t161588\t2\t161589\t2\t161591\t2\t161592\t2\t161593\t2\t161594\t2\t161595\t2\t161596\t2\t161597\t2\t161599\t2\t161600\t2\t161602\t2\t161603\t2\t161604\t2\t161606\t2\t161607\t2\t161613\t2\t161614\t2\t161618\t2\t161624\t2\t161624\t2\t161624\t2\t161631\t2\t161655\t2\t16133\t2\t16136\t2\t161723\t2\t161724\t2\t161760\t2\t161771\t2\t161772\t2\t161772\t2\t161799\t2\t16176\t2\t16190\t2\t16195\t2\t161800\t2\t161801\t2\t161805\t2\t161806\t2\t161808\t2\t161836\t2\t161866\t2\t161867\t2\t161889\t2\t161104\t2\t161105\t2\t161110\t2\t161111\t2\t161113\t2\t161132\t2\t161147\t2\t161155\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161161\t2\t161163\t2\t161163\t2\t161183\t2\t161184\t2\t161193\t2\t161197\t2\t161199\t2\t161900\t2\t161936\t2\t161937\t2\t161946\t2\t161956\t2\t161959\t2\t161989\t2\t161201\t2\t161202\t2\t161203\t2\t161204\t2\t161205\t2\t161209\t2\t161212\t2\t161217\t2\t161220\t2\t161222\t2\t161243\t2\t161284\t2\t161286\t2\t161294\t2\t161295\t2\t1611030\t2\t1611056\t2\t1611084\t2\t1611095\t2\t1611102\t2\t1611102\t2\t1611107\t2\t1611111\t2\t1611151\t2\t1611222\t2\t1611287\t2\t1611293\t2\t1611296\t2\t1611297\t2\t1611298\t2\t1611298\t2\t1611299\t2\t1611300\t2\t1611327\t2\t1611346\t2\t1611347\t2\t1611353\t2\t1611361\t2\t1611373\t2\t1611373\t2\t1611404\t2\t1611405\t2\t1611446\t2\t1611447\t2\t161300\t2\t161356\t2\t161358\t2\t161375\t2\t161",

There area number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a muchsmaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious andless inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist librariesin the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted withsocial scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians inscientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support thiskind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had itsdisadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and wewere therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand,we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparablestudies.

If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasingrequirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, becausethe searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to hisavailable search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree oforder attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on thebasis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by thesepostulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higherare its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to bemade on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experiencewith the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basisof this system and of its further development..X445\t2\t165445\t2\t165448\t2\t165451\t2\t165452\t2\t165476\t2\t165484\t2\t165511\t2\t165516\t2\t165518\t2\t165521\t2\t165522\t2\t165523\t2\t165525\t2\t165525\t2\t165526\t2\t165527\t2\t165528\t2\t165529\t2\t165530\t2\t165575\t2\t165590\t2\t165590\t2\t165609\t2\t165610\t2\t165615\t2\t165621\t2\t165621\t2\t165621\t2\t165625\t2\t165626\t2\t165636\t2\t165641\t2\t165641\t2\t165641\t2\t165656\t2\t165668\t2\t165670\t2\t165671\t2\t165671\t2\t165673\t2\t165674\t2\t165683\t2\t165683\t2\t165689\t2\t165689\t2\t165689\t2\t165687\t2\t16529\t2\t165700\t2\t165705\t2\t165707\t2\t165714\t2\t165715\t2\t165727\t2\t165754\t2\t165762\t2\t16558\t2\t165797\t2\t165812\t2\t165814\t2\t165817\t2\t165819\t2\t165824\t2\t165875\t2\t165898\t2\t165117\t2\t165124\t2\t165125\t2\t165165\t2\t165165\t2\t165165\t2\t165165\t2\t165165\t2\t165165\t2\t165165\t2\t165901\t2\t165252\t2\t165254\t2\t1651077\t2\t1651077\t2\t1651077\t2\t1651089\t2\t1651231\t2\t1651231\t2\t1651231\t2\t1651231\t2\t1651303\t2\t1651327\t2\t1651364\t2\t1651366\t2\t1651367\t2\t1651368\t2\t1651404\t2\t1651452\t2\t165347\t2\t165381\t2\t165",

In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Randcorporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase fromfive million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and theirtotal productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assessthe associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merelystated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which sciencewould actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concernthe publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if wedo not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we willnot be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will becomeredundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would beironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regardthe chance to do something about the flow of information as a response toopportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort outwhat is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs ofthe scientist to this mass of information..X491\t2\t166496\t2\t166582\t2\t166657\t2\t166690\t2\t16637\t2\t166760\t2\t16663\t2\t166166\t2\t166166\t2\t166166\t2\t166166\t2\t166166\t2\t166907\t2\t1661012\t2\t1661111\t2\t1661115\t2\t1661115\t2\t1661293\t2\t1661295\t2\t1661296\t2\t1661446\t2\t1661447\t2\t166",

    "words": "The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determiningthe interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is byno means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed withreasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous butrarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt,1836).  His view that a language \"makes infinite use of finitemeans\" and that its grammar must describe the processes thatmake this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistentconcern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind,with this \"creative\" aspect of language use (for discussion, seeChomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that evenPanini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a\"generative grammar,\" in essentially the contemporary sense ofthis term.This monograph is an exploratory study of various problemsthat have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar,which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for thediscussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how thistheory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, withquestions that are at the border of research in transformationalgrammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but moreoften the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possibleapproaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions..X417\t2\t168443\t2\t168448\t2\t168479\t2\t168480\t2\t168483\t2\t168484\t2\t168486\t2\t168488\t2\t168488\t2\t168489\t2\t168491\t2\t168493\t2\t168493\t2\t168499\t2\t168498\t2\t168503\t2\t168507\t2\t168509\t2\t168510\t2\t168512\t2\t168517\t2\t168520\t2\t168522\t2\t168527\t2\t168528\t2\t168531\t2\t168546\t2\t168558\t2\t168558\t2\t168565\t2\t168566\t2\t168566\t2\t168570\t2\t168572\t2\t168572\t2\t168572\t2\t168581\t2\t168581\t2\t168590\t2\t168596\t2\t168603\t2\t168608\t2\t168608\t2\t168633\t2\t168659\t2\t168659\t2\t16821\t2\t168715\t2\t168746\t2\t168754\t2\t16851\t2\t168790\t2\t168790\t2\t16869\t2\t16869\t2\t16871\t2\t16877\t2\t16877\t2\t16879\t2\t16879\t2\t168805\t2\t168809\t2\t168810\t2\t168812\t2\t168813\t2\t168814\t2\t168817\t2\t168817\t2\t168819\t2\t168824\t2\t168825\t2\t168825\t2\t168894\t2\t168118\t2\t168160\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168168\t2\t168174\t2\t168175\t2\t168175\t2\t168176\t2\t168902\t2\t168902\t2\t168258\t2\t1681024\t2\t1681027\t2\t1681045\t2\t1681046\t2\t1681046\t2\t1681046\t2\t1681047\t2\t1681051\t2\t1681118\t2\t1681144\t2\t1681213\t2\t1681215\t2\t1681215\t2\t1681225\t2\t1681230\t2\t1681231\t2\t1681294\t2\t1681294\t2\t1681310\t2\t1681327\t2\t1681327\t2\t1681386\t2\t1681388\t2\t1681389\t2\t1681399\t2\t1681399\t2\t1681399\t2\t1681399\t2\t1681399\t2\t1681413\t2\t1681419\t2\t1681427\t2\t1681443\t2\t1681443\t2\t1681443\t2\t1681443\t2\t1681448\t2\t168315\t2\t168317\t2\t168317\t2\t168317\t2\t168317\t2\t168317\t2\t168320\t2\t168320\t2\t168324\t2\t168324\t2\t168332\t2\t168382\t2\t168388\t2\t168399\t2\t168",

    "words": "This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussionof the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to theirsurrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not atextbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choiceof topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide anelementary description of either.  For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumedthat the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in informationretrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind ofretrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or thatbetween the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and theuse of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally,in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means ofcharacterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument;but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this,or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which hasraged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view ofmy main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios..X419\t2\t176419\t2\t176419\t2\t176434\t2\t176446\t2\t176448\t2\t176448\t2\t176458\t2\t176458\t2\t176480\t2\t176483\t2\t176483\t2\t176484\t2\t176486\t2\t176488\t2\t176488\t2\t176488\t2\t176491\t2\t176493\t2\t176499\t2\t176500\t2\t176503\t2\t176507\t2\t176509\t2\t176509\t2\t176509\t2\t176509\t2\t176510\t2\t176512\t2\t176517\t2\t176517\t2\t176520\t2\t176522\t2\t176522\t2\t176527\t2\t176527\t2\t176528\t2\t176531\t2\t176565\t2\t176565\t2\t176565\t2\t176565\t2\t176565\t2\t176566\t2\t176566\t2\t176570\t2\t176572\t2\t176576\t2\t176577\t2\t176577\t2\t176581\t2\t176595\t2\t176596\t2\t176596\t2\t176596\t2\t176596\t2\t176603\t2\t176608\t2\t176608\t2\t176619\t2\t176633\t2\t176644\t2\t176659\t2\t176659\t2\t176660\t2\t176660\t2\t176661\t2\t176662\t2\t176662\t2\t176664\t2\t17626\t2\t17630\t2\t176715\t2\t176754\t2\t17651\t2\t17651\t2\t17651\t2\t17657\t2\t17657\t2\t176785\t2\t176790\t2\t17661\t2\t17669\t2\t17671\t2\t17671\t2\t17675\t2\t17677\t2\t17677\t2\t17679\t2\t17673\t2\t176805\t2\t176809\t2\t176810\t2\t176810\t2\t176812\t2\t176812\t2\t176812\t2\t176813\t2\t176813\t2\t176814\t2\t176814\t2\t176817\t2\t176824\t2\t176824\t2\t176825\t2\t176830\t2\t176870\t2\t176894\t2\t176894\t2\t176114\t2\t176144\t2\t176168\t2\t176175\t2\t176175\t2\t176175\t2\t176175\t2\t176175\t2\t176175\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176176\t2\t176928\t2\t176963\t2\t176990\t2\t176991\t2\t1761044\t2\t1761051\t2\t1761218\t2\t1761255\t2\t1761294\t2\t1761307\t2\t1761327\t2\t1761327\t2\t1761413\t2\t1761414\t2\t1761419\t2\t1761427\t2\t1761445\t2\t1761448\t2\t176315\t2\t176327\t2\t176329\t2\t176363\t2\t176382\t2\t176",

    "words": "My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understandingof what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limitedmyself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed \"libraryhousekeeping\" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing,periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is tomake a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, anddisseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processeswhich can be automated here and now to improve the quality ofservice which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that thedescriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librariansin developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries..X406\t2\t177408\t2\t177408\t2\t177458\t2\t177471\t2\t17724\t2\t17775\t2\t17778\t2\t17780\t2\t177849\t2\t177852\t2\t177853\t2\t177854\t2\t177855\t2\t177897\t2\t177177\t2\t177177\t2\t177177\t2\t177177\t2\t177177\t2\t177177\t2\t177177\t2\t177916\t2\t177979\t2\t177984\t2\t177281\t2\t177287\t2\t1771007\t2\t1771011\t2\t1771248\t2\t1771327\t2\t1771433\t2\t177336\t2\t177348\t2\t177374\t2\t177",

Automationcan also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  Inall of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices areanalysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role ofmachine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than tocompletely replace man.The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for informationhave come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  Thesesystems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,the latter playing the most prominent part..X572\t2\t180683\t2\t18078\t2\t180179\t2\t180180\t2\t180180\t2\t180180\t2\t180180\t2\t180180\t2\t180180\t2\t1801139\t2\t1801168\t2\t1801171\t2\t1801409\t2\t180363\t2\t180",

Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed thepetition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formedby Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group ofthe Medical Library Association.This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Officeof Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of ourspecialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminologyin the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitionsfor Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by thecommittee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the UnitedStates and Canada.

The system, called AIM-TWX, wassponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communicationsand utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, includingthose currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrievedeither on- or off-line..Various aspects of this service are described, including problems ofstaffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSHvocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog..The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were runon any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of aninexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whosetraining schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment washighly successful in terms of searches and citations..At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded nocitations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interestamong the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a largenumber of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginiaparticipated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demandfor this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide withgreat rapidity...X445\t2\t197450\t2\t197451\t2\t197452\t2\t197454\t2\t197459\t2\t197468\t2\t197472\t2\t197484\t2\t197492\t2\t197503\t2\t197506\t2\t197506\t2\t197507\t2\t197508\t2\t197511\t2\t197512\t2\t197514\t2\t197518\t2\t197520\t2\t197523\t2\t197524\t2\t197525\t2\t197526\t2\t197529\t2\t197530\t2\t197534\t2\t197546\t2\t197546\t2\t197553\t2\t197554\t2\t197579\t2\t197579\t2\t197591\t2\t197593\t2\t197593\t2\t197594\t2\t197594\t2\t197594\t2\t197595\t2\t197596\t2\t197597\t2\t197599\t2\t197600\t2\t197603\t2\t197603\t2\t197604\t2\t197604\t2\t197606\t2\t197606\t2\t197606\t2\t197609\t2\t197610\t2\t197611\t2\t197612\t2\t197625\t2\t197626\t2\t197630\t2\t197634\t2\t197636\t2\t197637\t2\t197642\t2\t197648\t2\t197650\t2\t197692\t2\t197696\t2\t197696\t2\t197699\t2\t197703\t2\t197705\t2\t197705\t2\t197708\t2\t197723\t2\t197724\t2\t197726\t2\t197727\t2\t197728\t2\t197731\t2\t197732\t2\t197733\t2\t197734\t2\t197736\t2\t197736\t2\t197738\t2\t197739\t2\t197740\t2\t197741\t2\t197742\t2\t197743\t2\t197744\t2\t197755\t2\t197795\t2\t19766\t2\t197801\t2\t197805\t2\t197806\t2\t197820\t2\t197826\t2\t197826\t2\t197827\t2\t197836\t2\t197866\t2\t197867\t2\t197879\t2\t197883\t2\t197120\t2\t197124\t2\t197127\t2\t197129\t2\t197161\t2\t197190\t2\t197191\t2\t197197\t2\t197197\t2\t197197\t2\t197197\t2\t197197\t2\t197956\t2\t197989\t2\t197211\t2\t197214\t2\t197218\t2\t197218\t2\t197243\t2\t1971004\t2\t1971035\t2\t1971035\t2\t1971078\t2\t1971089\t2\t1971091\t2\t1971207\t2\t1971264\t2\t1971297\t2\t1971298\t2\t1971299\t2\t1971303\t2\t1971327\t2\t1971356\t2\t1971364\t2\t1971368\t2\t1971370\t2\t1971372\t2\t1971373\t2\t1971374\t2\t1971375\t2\t1971376\t2\t1971377\t2\t1971405\t2\t197307\t2\t197330\t2\t197332\t2\t197375\t2\t197378\t2\t197382\t2\t197",

    "words": "For many years administrators of library collections have soughtobjective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collectionsin the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearestapproach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledgeof the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  Thismethod consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations atthe conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field underconsideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of thefrequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, thereferences in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted anda list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Grossand Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a libraryto purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twentyyears, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based havenever been examined.  These assumptions are:1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in directproportion to the number of times it is cited in the professionalliterature.2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation arerepresentative of the entire field.3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weightedequally..X415\t2\t198543\t2\t198545\t2\t198552\t2\t198588\t2\t198614\t2\t198616\t2\t198616\t2\t198632\t2\t198635\t2\t198638\t2\t198685\t2\t19831\t2\t19833\t2\t19836\t2\t19836\t2\t19837\t2\t19841\t2\t19841\t2\t19846\t2\t198735\t2\t198735\t2\t198735\t2\t198760\t2\t198766\t2\t198767\t2\t198774\t2\t198775\t2\t198778\t2\t198784\t2\t198789\t2\t19876\t2\t19889\t2\t198821\t2\t198828\t2\t198831\t2\t198891\t2\t198891\t2\t198181\t2\t198182\t2\t198183\t2\t198183\t2\t198184\t2\t198184\t2\t198185\t2\t198193\t2\t198193\t2\t198195\t2\t198195\t2\t198196\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198198\t2\t198199\t2\t198905\t2\t198905\t2\t198952\t2\t198952\t2\t198953\t2\t198964\t2\t198968\t2\t198201\t2\t198201\t2\t198201\t2\t198203\t2\t198204\t2\t198211\t2\t198217\t2\t198220\t2\t198269\t2\t1981009\t2\t1981018\t2\t1981019\t2\t1981055\t2\t1981071\t2\t1981147\t2\t1981210\t2\t1981240\t2\t1981260\t2\t1981275\t2\t1981275\t2\t1981275\t2\t1981275\t2\t1981275\t2\t1981276\t2\t1981290\t2\t1981302\t2\t1981302\t2\t1981302\t2\t1981302\t2\t1981355\t2\t1981359\t2\t1981397\t2\t1981397\t2\t1981397\t2\t1981417\t2\t1981432\t2\t198361\t2\t198379\t2\t198395\t2\t198",

    "words": "Mechanical means for expediting library work have been consideredfor many years, as an examination of the early pages of LibraryJournals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin,the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained anarticle on the use of the \"typewriting machine\" in cataloging.  Telephoneshave long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusualitems, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.Nevertheless, when the term \"machine methods\" is used for librariestoday, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronicequipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to affordsuch equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but thelargest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library ofMedicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanicalmethods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations..X617\t2\t200620\t2\t20064\t2\t20064\t2\t200849\t2\t200850\t2\t200979\t2\t200979\t2\t200978\t2\t200200\t2\t200200\t2\t200200\t2\t200200\t2\t200200\t2\t200200\t2\t200211\t2\t200281\t2\t2001051\t2\t2001252\t2\t200",

Columbia received nearly 2,000 journals and Yale over1,500; findings are based upon an analysis of canceled charge slips for issuespublished from 1959 through June 1962.. This combined study of recorded usagefor six months in the Columbia Medical Library (12.9 percent of circulationduring January through June 1962) and for one year in the Yale Medical Library(12.5 percent of 1961/62 circulation) revealed that a core of 262 journalssupplied 80 percent of use of titles published in the 1959 to mid-1962period.. However, it is probable that current issues of all titles receivedwere used at least once within the libraries.. Titles of sixty-seven journalswhich supplied slightly more than 50 percent of use are listed...X415\t2\t201475\t2\t201543\t2\t201552\t2\t201554\t2\t201587\t2\t201588\t2\t201613\t2\t201614\t2\t201624\t2\t201638\t2\t201667\t2\t20131\t2\t20131\t2\t20131\t2\t20133\t2\t20136\t2\t20136\t2\t20136\t2\t20136\t2\t20141\t2\t20146\t2\t201735\t2\t201748\t2\t201748\t2\t201750\t2\t201751\t2\t201759\t2\t201760\t2\t201765\t2\t201766\t2\t201767\t2\t201767\t2\t201767\t2\t20157\t2\t201774\t2\t201778\t2\t201778\t2\t201784\t2\t201787\t2\t201791\t2\t201792\t2\t201793\t2\t201799\t2\t20176\t2\t20189\t2\t20190\t2\t201800\t2\t201800\t2\t201808\t2\t201821\t2\t201821\t2\t201828\t2\t201889\t2\t201891\t2\t201891\t2\t201121\t2\t201161\t2\t201181\t2\t201181\t2\t201182\t2\t201182\t2\t201183\t2\t201183\t2\t201183\t2\t201183\t2\t201183\t2\t201184\t2\t201184\t2\t201184\t2\t201184\t2\t201184\t2\t201185\t2\t201189\t2\t201193\t2\t201193\t2\t201193\t2\t201193\t2\t201193\t2\t201193\t2\t201193\t2\t201195\t2\t201195\t2\t201195\t2\t201196\t2\t201196\t2\t201198\t2\t201198\t2\t201198\t2\t201199\t2\t201905\t2\t201905\t2\t201952\t2\t201953\t2\t201959\t2\t201964\t2\t201968\t2\t201977\t2\t201977\t2\t201977\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201201\t2\t201202\t2\t201203\t2\t201203\t2\t201203\t2\t201203\t2\t201203\t2\t201203\t2\t201204\t2\t201204\t2\t201204\t2\t201204\t2\t201204\t2\t201205\t2\t201205\t2\t201205\t2\t201205\t2\t201209\t2\t201210\t2\t201211\t2\t201212\t2\t201217\t2\t201217\t2\t201219\t2\t201220\t2\t201220\t2\t201222\t2\t201233\t2\t201267\t2\t201269\t2\t201269\t2\t201284\t2\t201286\t2\t201294\t2\t2011009\t2\t2011018\t2\t2011019\t2\t2011019\t2\t2011055\t2\t2011081\t2\t2011083\t2\t2011085\t2\t2011086\t2\t2011086\t2\t2011082\t2\t2011151\t2\t2011173\t2\t2011201\t2\t2011203\t2\t2011203\t2\t2011203\t2\t2011240\t2\t2011256\t2\t2011275\t2\t2011275\t2\t2011278\t2\t2011302\t2\t2011352\t2\t2011352\t2\t2011352\t2\t2011355\t2\t2011359\t2\t2011369\t2\t2011369\t2\t2011397\t2\t2011397\t2\t2011397\t2\t2011397\t2\t2011397\t2\t2011401\t2\t2011417\t2\t2011417\t2\t2011418\t2\t2011432\t2\t2011451\t2\t201359\t2\t201359\t2\t201373\t2\t201373\t2\t201373\t2\t201379\t2\t201395\t2\t201395\t2\t201",

Probingfor this information has been undertaken by means of structured  andunstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfactionproduced by present information services and does not yield insight into theextent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon theresponse of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations ofunderlying information needs..Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information systemmust, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience ofbiomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation whichcan explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individualssuch as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect toenvironment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medicalpractitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of theircolleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medicalschools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in amethodology which will permit the determination and prediction of theinformation needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment...X421\t2\t202465\t2\t202466\t2\t202490\t2\t202491\t2\t202506\t2\t202507\t2\t202510\t2\t202512\t2\t202543\t2\t202588\t2\t202591\t2\t202595\t2\t202603\t2\t202604\t2\t202613\t2\t202622\t2\t202623\t2\t202624\t2\t202629\t2\t202633\t2\t202639\t2\t202659\t2\t202676\t2\t20218\t2\t20233\t2\t20234\t2\t20236\t2\t20242\t2\t20249\t2\t202711\t2\t202722\t2\t202723\t2\t202726\t2\t202728\t2\t202730\t2\t202731\t2\t202732\t2\t20253\t2\t20259\t2\t202799\t2\t20290\t2\t202800\t2\t202808\t2\t202809\t2\t202810\t2\t202813\t2\t202814\t2\t202820\t2\t202822\t2\t202828\t2\t202870\t2\t202879\t2\t202891\t2\t202132\t2\t202161\t2\t202164\t2\t202183\t2\t202184\t2\t202184\t2\t202193\t2\t202193\t2\t202199\t2\t202928\t2\t202959\t2\t202965\t2\t202973\t2\t202201\t2\t202202\t2\t202202\t2\t202202\t2\t202202\t2\t202202\t2\t202202\t2\t202203\t2\t202203\t2\t202204\t2\t202205\t2\t202209\t2\t202210\t2\t202212\t2\t202213\t2\t202217\t2\t202220\t2\t202222\t2\t202224\t2\t202243\t2\t202284\t2\t202286\t2\t202294\t2\t2021091\t2\t2021151\t2\t2021283\t2\t2021298\t2\t2021299\t2\t2021363\t2\t2021366\t2\t2021367\t2\t2021368\t2\t2021396\t2\t202",

It fails utterly to report or even tosuggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources.. Theactual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in thelibrary situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulatedanalysis and are explained at length.. A positive design is offered for theobjective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use andphysical handling of serials and the relating of resources..

Specific tests employing samples of 300 documents have beendeveloped that are appropriate for academic an for \"reservoir\" biomedicallibraries.. Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests arepractical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible..When strict comparability is not important, a library can test itself.. Inassessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on itstypical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these testsare being used in a national survey..

    "words": "The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school librariesoffer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of theselibraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier(Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive dataobtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented andcommented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggestthat increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over thepast two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume ofservice, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth ofservices.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries thedescriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; theweighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librariansto reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall servicesrelative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a singlefigure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of someexploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti findexplanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographicalregions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the surveydata for managerial and research purposes are discussed..

This survey led to the formulation of six criterionconcepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefitratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method ofmeasurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during theanalysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with therationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably leadto a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of thepurpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarelyconsidered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation ratherthan as part of the whole..

    "words": "The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-twomedical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedicalresearchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for fillingI-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarizedas statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents inthe test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of themean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability affordedby its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection,processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gainrealized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particularlibrary, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variablescan be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the statusstatistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictionsof basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of thiswork is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decisionaids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys andfurther development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the MedicalLibrary Association...X5\t2\t2239\t2\t223435\t2\t223468\t2\t223494\t2\t223515\t2\t223535\t2\t223550\t2\t223591\t2\t223615\t2\t223625\t2\t223629\t2\t223631\t2\t223634\t2\t223639\t2\t223646\t2\t223647\t2\t223651\t2\t22314\t2\t223765\t2\t223791\t2\t223792\t2\t22390\t2\t22391\t2\t223811\t2\t223815\t2\t223815\t2\t223816\t2\t223816\t2\t223818\t2\t223818\t2\t223822\t2\t223823\t2\t223823\t2\t223827\t2\t223843\t2\t223844\t2\t223846\t2\t223128\t2\t223129\t2\t223130\t2\t223153\t2\t223158\t2\t223167\t2\t223170\t2\t223915\t2\t223925\t2\t223943\t2\t223944\t2\t223945\t2\t223957\t2\t223961\t2\t223962\t2\t223962\t2\t223964\t2\t223964\t2\t223994\t2\t223207\t2\t223208\t2\t223217\t2\t223222\t2\t223222\t2\t223222\t2\t223222\t2\t223223\t2\t223223\t2\t223223\t2\t223223\t2\t223223\t2\t223223\t2\t223225\t2\t223234\t2\t223266\t2\t223271\t2\t223280\t2\t223296\t2\t223297\t2\t223298\t2\t2231015\t2\t2231019\t2\t2231023\t2\t2231028\t2\t2231070\t2\t2231085\t2\t2231086\t2\t2231090\t2\t2231219\t2\t2231227\t2\t2231242\t2\t2231247\t2\t2231268\t2\t2231354\t2\t2231365\t2\t2231374\t2\t2231390\t2\t2231390\t2\t2231401\t2\t2231424\t2\t2231437\t2\t223300\t2\t223301\t2\t223302\t2\t223358\t2\t223364\t2\t223368\t2\t223393\t2\t223",

    "words": "The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCMand PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio hasintensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis forsuch a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartleyon this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include anumber of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, andthe savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original messageand due to the nature of the final destination of the information.The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing atone point either exactly or approximately a message selected at anotherpoint.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or arecorrelated according to some system with certain physical or conceptualentities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to theengineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message isone selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designedto operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actuallybe chosen since this is unknown at the time of design..X416\t2\t228416\t2\t228416\t2\t228442\t2\t228442\t2\t228442\t2\t228450\t2\t228450\t2\t228469\t2\t228495\t2\t228495\t2\t228494\t2\t228505\t2\t228511\t2\t228511\t2\t228511\t2\t228521\t2\t228524\t2\t228524\t2\t228524\t2\t228536\t2\t228540\t2\t228563\t2\t228565\t2\t228567\t2\t228574\t2\t228587\t2\t228599\t2\t22819\t2\t22819\t2\t228700\t2\t228750\t2\t228751\t2\t228792\t2\t22873\t2\t228803\t2\t228804\t2\t228835\t2\t228835\t2\t228851\t2\t228851\t2\t228862\t2\t228862\t2\t228867\t2\t228867\t2\t228875\t2\t228149\t2\t228175\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228228\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t228229\t2\t2281085\t2\t2281086\t2\t2281082\t2\t2281082\t2\t2281194\t2\t2281194\t2\t2281194\t2\t2281199\t2\t2281199\t2\t2281199\t2\t2281224\t2\t2281232\t2\t2281274\t2\t2281282\t2\t2281313\t2\t2281396\t2\t2281398\t2\t228318\t2\t228321\t2\t228321\t2\t228321\t2\t228324\t2\t228329\t2\t228329\t2\t228329\t2\t228359\t2\t228389\t2\t228390\t2\t228",

    "words": "In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where thesignals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast withthe discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent thecontinuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discretecase by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finitenumber of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved ona discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters ingeneral approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  Thereare, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change ofemphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results toparticular cases.We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results withthe greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, sincethis would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and wouldobscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic andrigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases andmany others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in thepresent analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest..X469\t2\t229494\t2\t229521\t2\t229540\t2\t229574\t2\t229587\t2\t22919\t2\t229700\t2\t229750\t2\t229751\t2\t229792\t2\t22973\t2\t229804\t2\t229867\t2\t229149\t2\t229175\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229228\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t229229\t2\t2291085\t2\t2291086\t2\t2291082\t2\t2291199\t2\t2291224\t2\t2291232\t2\t2291274\t2\t2291282\t2\t2291313\t2\t229321\t2\t229329\t2\t229359\t2\t229",

    "words": "The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Onlynow and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding ofthe implications of theory, is some detail of practice brieflydescribed.It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry anddescription, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, orother similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on suchworks, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few ofwhat seem to be the most important aspects of each.Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.Many interesting practices have always been part of catalogingabroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken severalbooks.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seemsnecessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If areader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful,that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging.I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in thiscountry will be of value in other countries with other conditions.

The CALBPC project was begun in 1965by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effortto establish a centralized acquisition and processingcenter.  The report of Phase I-II, completedin June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibilitystudy, the design of the central system, costsof acquiring and processing in nine libraries and anumber of related concerns such as accounting, thecongruence of approval plans and user attitudes towardlibrary services.This report focuses on the experimental operationswhich were concluded officially on September 30,1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with thetheory and principles upon which a system mightbe based, we are presently concerned with thepragmatics of book processing, the obstaclesencountered, and the solutions achieved.Although this report deals primarily withcooperative acquisitions and processing, we believeit also contributes to a better understanding ofcooperative programs.  The experiment was designedto monitor operations throughout the acquisition/cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurementswere made on most internal and external aspectsof the system.  Monitoring also extended intothe participating libraries where a productacceptance study was conducted.  A secondaryobjective of the project was to observe therelationships which formed between the participantsand the central agency, such as the interface ofsystems and the human interaction of participantsand the Center..X404\t2\t250408\t2\t25016\t2\t250855\t2\t250863\t2\t250864\t2\t250872\t2\t250897\t2\t250938\t2\t250974\t2\t250981\t2\t250984\t2\t250986\t2\t250214\t2\t250218\t2\t250235\t2\t250249\t2\t250249\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250250\t2\t250289\t2\t250295\t2\t2501012\t2\t2501152\t2\t2501188\t2\t2501247\t2\t2501257\t2\t2501317\t2\t2501379\t2\t2501390\t2\t2501392\t2\t2501410\t2\t250340\t2\t250348\t2\t250365\t2\t250375\t2\t250394\t2\t250",

Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads himto believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, thecatalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to thisincreased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other methodwhich he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing andindexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable fornumbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves..X1\t2\t2627\t2\t262950\t2\t262978\t2\t262240\t2\t262262\t2\t262262\t2\t262262\t2\t262262\t2\t262262\t2\t262262\t2\t2621028\t2\t2621068\t2\t2621203\t2\t2621211\t2\t2621211\t2\t2621212\t2\t2621212\t2\t2621266\t2\t2621266\t2\t2621424\t2\t2621425\t2\t262353\t2\t262365\t2\t262",

In the first, books were counted withinfinely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments..In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second lettersand the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in thesecond, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-librarycirculation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predictingin-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of outto in, and the regression equation...X46\t2\t29046\t2\t290925\t2\t290925\t2\t290943\t2\t290981\t2\t290266\t2\t290277\t2\t290280\t2\t290282\t2\t290282\t2\t290284\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t290290\t2\t2901019\t2\t2901023\t2\t2901203\t2\t2901203\t2\t2901416\t2\t290",

Its purpose isto generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can beused in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a pointof view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-makingand resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticatedtechniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made todiscuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any ofthe other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operationsresearch systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearlyunderstood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenalof the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, adelineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered inthis article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standardtechniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operationsresearcher, and occasionally, even the librarian..X408\t2\t291459\t2\t291548\t2\t291575\t2\t291591\t2\t291594\t2\t291597\t2\t291598\t2\t291599\t2\t291601\t2\t291621\t2\t291630\t2\t291692\t2\t291836\t2\t291863\t2\t291864\t2\t291865\t2\t291865\t2\t291866\t2\t291868\t2\t291897\t2\t291120\t2\t291128\t2\t291135\t2\t291178\t2\t291915\t2\t291916\t2\t291925\t2\t291925\t2\t291925\t2\t291936\t2\t291945\t2\t291957\t2\t291959\t2\t291960\t2\t291960\t2\t291961\t2\t291961\t2\t291962\t2\t291972\t2\t291982\t2\t291984\t2\t291235\t2\t291244\t2\t291245\t2\t291245\t2\t291249\t2\t291288\t2\t291289\t2\t291291\t2\t291291\t2\t291291\t2\t291291\t2\t291291\t2\t291291\t2\t291292\t2\t2911007\t2\t2911052\t2\t2911248\t2\t2911317\t2\t2911353\t2\t2911358\t2\t2911400\t2\t2911400\t2\t2911401\t2\t2911401\t2\t2911402\t2\t291",

Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in thehistory of American radical movements, is in some quarters growingwider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in theNew Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at leasttemporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In somepart it is due to the fact that these social movements are still newand their political activism consumes their necessarily limitedenergies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need timeto produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory isscarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the factthat American radicals are often more American than they know andmay prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to theintangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoreticalproblems is probably due to the close links that some young radicalshave with the \"hippie\" contingent of their generation, whose moreexpressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culturedispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile \"hassles\" ofintellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, ashas been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal toreason..X89\t2\t308105\t2\t308107\t2\t3081217\t2\t3081331\t2\t3081340\t2\t3081340\t2\t3081348\t2\t3081387\t2\t3081387\t2\t308308\t2\t308308\t2\t308308\t2\t308308\t2\t308308\t2\t308",

However, theseshould be relatively few.  In the case of an informationretrieval system, let us consider one whose function is tofurnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questionsQ, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q)which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot bechosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation betweenthe question and the resulting reference list.  Usuallyone says that the documents in the list are relevant tothe question.

This memory is a \"semantic network\" representingfactual assertions about the world.The program also creates copies of the parts of its memorywhich have been found to relate to the new text, adaptingand combining these copies to represent the meaning of thenew text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the programsuccessfully comprehends is encoded into the same format asthat of the memory.  In this form it can be added into thememory.Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilitiesfor correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are tobe taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presentlycontains a relatively small number of examples of suchassertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations forexpressing either of these are provided.  Thus the programnow corresponds to a general process for comprehendinglanguage, and it provides a methodology for adding theadditional information this process requires to actuallycomprehend text of any particular kind.The memory structure and comprehension process of TLCallow new factual assertions and capabilities for relatingtext to such stored assertions and capabilities for relatingtext to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into thesystem, it becomes available to help comprehend a great manyother sentences in the future..X458\t2\t320459\t2\t320488\t2\t320489\t2\t320493\t2\t320499\t2\t320498\t2\t320526\t2\t320546\t2\t320558\t2\t320570\t2\t320572\t2\t320579\t2\t320581\t2\t320590\t2\t320606\t2\t320626\t2\t320659\t2\t320664\t2\t320754\t2\t320790\t2\t32061\t2\t32077\t2\t32079\t2\t320814\t2\t320826\t2\t320117\t2\t320168\t2\t320168\t2\t320175\t2\t320274\t2\t3201035\t2\t3201046\t2\t3201046\t2\t3201118\t2\t3201294\t2\t3201399\t2\t3201427\t2\t3201443\t2\t3201443\t2\t3201443\t2\t320317\t2\t320317\t2\t320320\t2\t320320\t2\t320320\t2\t320320\t2\t320320\t2\t320320\t2\t320",

This could lead tosubstantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both indictionary look-up times and storage utilization..X416\t2\t329416\t2\t329416\t2\t329416\t2\t329442\t2\t329442\t2\t329442\t2\t329442\t2\t329442\t2\t329450\t2\t329450\t2\t329450\t2\t329450\t2\t329495\t2\t329495\t2\t329495\t2\t329511\t2\t329511\t2\t329511\t2\t329511\t2\t329511\t2\t329511\t2\t329521\t2\t329521\t2\t329524\t2\t329524\t2\t329536\t2\t329563\t2\t329565\t2\t329565\t2\t329565\t2\t329565\t2\t329567\t2\t329567\t2\t329567\t2\t329572\t2\t329595\t2\t329596\t2\t329608\t2\t329619\t2\t32919\t2\t32919\t2\t32944\t2\t329700\t2\t329700\t2\t32957\t2\t32957\t2\t329791\t2\t329791\t2\t329791\t2\t32975\t2\t329810\t2\t329812\t2\t329813\t2\t329814\t2\t329835\t2\t329851\t2\t329862\t2\t329867\t2\t329870\t2\t329872\t2\t329875\t2\t329875\t2\t329875\t2\t329894\t2\t329894\t2\t329176\t2\t329928\t2\t329963\t2\t329990\t2\t329991\t2\t329228\t2\t329228\t2\t329228\t2\t329229\t2\t3291194\t2\t3291194\t2\t3291196\t2\t3291199\t2\t3291199\t2\t3291199\t2\t3291255\t2\t3291362\t2\t3291396\t2\t3291398\t2\t3291413\t2\t3291445\t2\t329318\t2\t329318\t2\t329321\t2\t329321\t2\t329324\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329329\t2\t329346\t2\t329359\t2\t329",

At the present time there exist powerful technicalmodels of classification and highly developed classifications of variousbranches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory generalclassification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophicalproblems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification isimportant from the theoretical as well as practical point of view becausethe general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories ofknowledge.

The contribution of these librarypersonnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspectivehave led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However,as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved,there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences ofopinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating fromthe various professions.  In the present study, most of these differencesrelated to the input into and control over the policies of the nationalstructure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlinedin Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommendedmodel are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issuesare presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity ofopinions expressed, these areas are identified..X453\t2\t339629\t2\t339648\t2\t339652\t2\t339128\t2\t339130\t2\t339171\t2\t339191\t2\t339923\t2\t339924\t2\t339230\t2\t3391376\t2\t3391403\t2\t3391403\t2\t3391403\t2\t3391423\t2\t3391457\t2\t339339\t2\t339339\t2\t339339\t2\t339339\t2\t339339\t2\t339339\t2\t339371\t2\t339370\t2\t339376\t2\t339387\t2\t339387\t2\t339387\t2\t339",

Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,and state library agencies are included in this category.School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards ofschools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School librariesat the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level areincluded.Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions ofhigher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely knownfor their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,university libraries, and technical school libraries are included asacademic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, andLinda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.Special libraries are those directed toward making information availableto people within a particular organization with fairly well-definedinformation needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries ofnonprofit organizations are common examples.While distinctions between research and special libraries are notalways easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, noserious problems are created..X431\t2\t340431\t2\t340431\t2\t340855\t2\t340910\t2\t340937\t2\t340939\t2\t340939\t2\t340955\t2\t340986\t2\t340214\t2\t340218\t2\t340250\t2\t3401009\t2\t3401012\t2\t3401188\t2\t3401236\t2\t3401247\t2\t3401354\t2\t3401379\t2\t3401390\t2\t3401424\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340340\t2\t340348\t2\t340375\t2\t340",

Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimatedata the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of usturn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we drawmany of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that scienceprogresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process bywhich an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one;and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the oldertheory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment,or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a numberof classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, forexample, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observationwith scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts toproduce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientistsmay properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena andthat do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean..X417\t2\t343438\t2\t343514\t2\t343546\t2\t343606\t2\t343610\t2\t343611\t2\t343612\t2\t343626\t2\t343100\t2\t343101\t2\t343101\t2\t343102\t2\t3431063\t2\t3431187\t2\t3431271\t2\t3431271\t2\t3431271\t2\t3431272\t2\t3431272\t2\t3431289\t2\t3431296\t2\t3431310\t2\t3431310\t2\t3431311\t2\t3431311\t2\t3431314\t2\t3431339\t2\t3431340\t2\t3431345\t2\t3431386\t2\t3431386\t2\t3431386\t2\t3431386\t2\t3431387\t2\t3431387\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343343\t2\t343391\t2\t343",

The philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified,and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook oraudiovisual materials - interchangeably defined as those materials thatcommunicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli - are recommended,along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks.  Theirorganization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity forbasic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treatedin particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexibleenough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specificclientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbookmaterials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to-follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with establishedlibrary routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition,physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are includedto present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures..X911\t2\t352992\t2\t352231\t2\t352231\t2\t3521152\t2\t3521153\t2\t3521189\t2\t352352\t2\t352352\t2\t352352\t2\t352352\t2\t352352\t2\t352352\t2\t352383\t2\t352",

    "words": "Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as asubject for investigation.  Though we have now accumulated an adequate supplyof source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, servicestudies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries,no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of Americanlibrarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants fromthe past, but we have yet to convert them into history.The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of theliterature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication andnaivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of thedevelopment of American library services which could eventually be puttogether to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  Itundertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuingproblems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services inresearch libraries..X7\t2\t353927\t2\t353262\t2\t353298\t2\t3531008\t2\t3531068\t2\t3531203\t2\t3531211\t2\t3531211\t2\t3531212\t2\t3531231\t2\t3531247\t2\t3531266\t2\t3531425\t2\t353303\t2\t353353\t2\t353353\t2\t353353\t2\t353353\t2\t353353\t2\t353365\t2\t353",

Thus a basis forcomparisons and for judgements has been introduced which providesa foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programsof service to the disadvantaged might move.To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practicesin low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview andobservation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests ofthe community residents, (2) library services in relation to otheravailable community resources, (3) the nature and scope of theneighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of thelibrary system, and (4) available measures of the impact oreffectiveness of the program..X9\t2\t358406\t2\t358433\t2\t358433\t2\t358459\t2\t358515\t2\t358534\t2\t358535\t2\t358624\t2\t358625\t2\t358629\t2\t358631\t2\t358631\t2\t358634\t2\t35810\t2\t358702\t2\t358731\t2\t358732\t2\t358791\t2\t358811\t2\t358816\t2\t358817\t2\t358818\t2\t358820\t2\t358823\t2\t358823\t2\t358825\t2\t358826\t2\t358827\t2\t358828\t2\t358843\t2\t358844\t2\t358846\t2\t358896\t2\t358161\t2\t358190\t2\t358908\t2\t358915\t2\t358937\t2\t358937\t2\t358947\t2\t358948\t2\t358948\t2\t358946\t2\t358946\t2\t358946\t2\t358946\t2\t358946\t2\t358961\t2\t358962\t2\t358964\t2\t358994\t2\t358207\t2\t358208\t2\t358222\t2\t358223\t2\t358225\t2\t358232\t2\t358239\t2\t358239\t2\t358241\t2\t358244\t2\t358295\t2\t358296\t2\t358297\t2\t358298\t2\t3581005\t2\t3581005\t2\t3581005\t2\t3581005\t2\t3581015\t2\t3581017\t2\t3581018\t2\t3581018\t2\t3581032\t2\t3581033\t2\t3581056\t2\t3581056\t2\t3581056\t2\t3581056\t2\t3581058\t2\t3581079\t2\t3581145\t2\t3581145\t2\t3581146\t2\t3581227\t2\t3581230\t2\t3581240\t2\t3581240\t2\t3581242\t2\t3581247\t2\t3581257\t2\t3581268\t2\t3581354\t2\t3581373\t2\t3581379\t2\t3581384\t2\t3581390\t2\t3581403\t2\t358300\t2\t358300\t2\t358301\t2\t358302\t2\t358304\t2\t358305\t2\t358306\t2\t358331\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358358\t2\t358364\t2\t358385\t2\t358385\t2\t358394\t2\t358",

What they developed was of a far wider scopethan the establishment of a new technique dealing with printedand non-printed documents.The great deal which inspired them, and those who workedside by side with them, was to render accessible the totality ofwhat is crystallized from human thought and to make of it acommon treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehensionand to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwillof all nations.It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given tosee the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledgeand experience as scientist as well as librarian, not onlygave his strong and valuable support to the common work butadded to it fundamental and constructive new elements.Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives farmore than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Sucha compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiouslyenough, up to now, there is no good general treatise ondocumentation available.  But his book gives us before all thingsan abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts..X415\t2\t359416\t2\t359416\t2\t359416\t2\t359475\t2\t359487\t2\t359494\t2\t359505\t2\t359505\t2\t359505\t2\t359511\t2\t359515\t2\t359560\t2\t359573\t2\t359573\t2\t359573\t2\t359573\t2\t359587\t2\t359587\t2\t359602\t2\t359616\t2\t359618\t2\t359618\t2\t359625\t2\t359632\t2\t359634\t2\t359635\t2\t359635\t2\t359667\t2\t359667\t2\t35919\t2\t35931\t2\t35936\t2\t35937\t2\t35939\t2\t35940\t2\t35941\t2\t35944\t2\t35944\t2\t35947\t2\t359700\t2\t359744\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359748\t2\t359749\t2\t359750\t2\t359750\t2\t359751\t2\t359751\t2\t359751\t2\t359751\t2\t359751\t2\t359751\t2\t359751\t2\t359756\t2\t359759\t2\t359759\t2\t359759\t2\t359759\t2\t359759\t2\t359764\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359765\t2\t359767\t2\t359767\t2\t359767\t2\t35957\t2\t35957\t2\t359775\t2\t359776\t2\t359777\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t359778\t2\t35955\t2\t359782\t2\t359787\t2\t359787\t2\t359787\t2\t359787\t2\t359787\t2\t359788\t2\t359791\t2\t359791\t2\t359791\t2\t359791\t2\t359791\t2\t359791\t2\t359792\t2\t359792\t2\t359793\t2\t35962\t2\t35962\t2\t35962\t2\t35976\t2\t35981\t2\t35988\t2\t35989\t2\t35997\t2\t35998\t2\t359800\t2\t359800\t2\t359804\t2\t359804\t2\t359804\t2\t359805\t2\t359872\t2\t359893\t2\t359893\t2\t359893\t2\t359893\t2\t359893\t2\t359100\t2\t359102\t2\t359103\t2\t359107\t2\t359111\t2\t359131\t2\t359131\t2\t359133\t2\t359136\t2\t359138\t2\t359140\t2\t359149\t2\t359162\t2\t359167\t2\t359175\t2\t359184\t2\t359189\t2\t359193\t2\t359195\t2\t359196\t2\t359905\t2\t359915\t2\t359925\t2\t359952\t2\t359952\t2\t359961\t2\t359201\t2\t359201\t2\t359203\t2\t359204\t2\t359205\t2\t359210\t2\t359215\t2\t359219\t2\t359221\t2\t359221\t2\t359228\t2\t359229\t2\t359233\t2\t359233\t2\t359253\t2\t359255\t2\t359267\t2\t3591016\t2\t3591016\t2\t3591016\t2\t3591016\t2\t3591016\t2\t3591019\t2\t3591030\t2\t3591055\t2\t3591061\t2\t3591062\t2\t3591071\t2\t3591071\t2\t3591076\t2\t3591081\t2\t3591081\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591083\t2\t3591084\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591085\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591086\t2\t3591087\t2\t3591087\t2\t3591082\t2\t3591082\t2\t3591090\t2\t3591090\t2\t3591090\t2\t3591097\t2\t3591098\t2\t3591114\t2\t3591122\t2\t3591147\t2\t3591157\t2\t3591173\t2\t3591173\t2\t3591173\t2\t3591182\t2\t3591182\t2\t3591182\t2\t3591182\t2\t3591182\t2\t3591196\t2\t3591200\t2\t3591201\t2\t3591201\t2\t3591201\t2\t3591203\t2\t3591226\t2\t3591274\t2\t3591275\t2\t3591277\t2\t3591278\t2\t3591278\t2\t3591280\t2\t3591282\t2\t3591285\t2\t3591287\t2\t3591291\t2\t3591296\t2\t3591301\t2\t3591301\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591302\t2\t3591304\t2\t3591313\t2\t3591317\t2\t3591338\t2\t3591344\t2\t3591347\t2\t3591352\t2\t3591380\t2\t3591401\t2\t3591417\t2\t3591418\t2\t3591428\t2\t3591444\t2\t359313\t2\t359314\t2\t359329\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359359\t2\t359373\t2\t359377\t2\t359378\t2\t359379\t2\t359379\t2\t359382\t2\t359395\t2\t359395\t2\t359",

What types of households use the library?  Whydo some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the variousservices provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library taketo improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among thedifferent circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books tobe checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is aninvestment in a security system worthwhile?We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - theBeverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodologyfor determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that aroseduring our investigation.

In the courseof our study, we have examined the data for comprehensivenessand consistency; we have investigated their intertemporalbehavior, both as a basis for projection and as aninstrument for long-range planning; and we have constructeda set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derivestatistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the mostcritical economic variables relating to library operations.  Inparticular, in the course of this last step, we have providedrelationships explaining statistically the determination ofsuch variables as the size of libraries' budgets and themagnitude of their professional staffs..X5\t2\t365408\t2\t365453\t2\t365453\t2\t365526\t2\t365528\t2\t365529\t2\t365612\t2\t365630\t2\t365652\t2\t365764\t2\t365811\t2\t365816\t2\t365818\t2\t365822\t2\t365823\t2\t365825\t2\t365842\t2\t365854\t2\t365856\t2\t365871\t2\t365872\t2\t365872\t2\t365873\t2\t365874\t2\t365875\t2\t365876\t2\t365877\t2\t365878\t2\t365879\t2\t365880\t2\t365886\t2\t365888\t2\t365892\t2\t365115\t2\t365119\t2\t365122\t2\t365141\t2\t365172\t2\t365913\t2\t365925\t2\t365938\t2\t365940\t2\t365940\t2\t365941\t2\t365943\t2\t365944\t2\t365948\t2\t365963\t2\t365974\t2\t365984\t2\t365990\t2\t365994\t2\t365997\t2\t365998\t2\t365234\t2\t365244\t2\t365245\t2\t365249\t2\t365250\t2\t365262\t2\t365299\t2\t3651004\t2\t3651023\t2\t3651068\t2\t3651079\t2\t3651143\t2\t3651143\t2\t3651203\t2\t3651211\t2\t3651212\t2\t3651230\t2\t3651247\t2\t3651257\t2\t3651257\t2\t3651257\t2\t3651258\t2\t3651264\t2\t3651266\t2\t3651303\t2\t3651317\t2\t3651367\t2\t3651396\t2\t3651425\t2\t3651433\t2\t3651435\t2\t3651435\t2\t3651436\t2\t3651436\t2\t3651441\t2\t365353\t2\t365364\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365365\t2\t365394\t2\t365",

To take but onefield, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papersto be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first millionto be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where onemillion papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - andbefore 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equalto the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will bepublished and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial beganpublication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science MuseumLibrary was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only afurther 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the useof scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 theN.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the ScienceMuseum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that ofall the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a periodwhich itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application forpeaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in syntheticmaterials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examplesmay not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be ata very high level indeed..X2\t2\t371465\t2\t371466\t2\t371475\t2\t371480\t2\t371480\t2\t371658\t2\t371682\t2\t371681\t2\t37122\t2\t371704\t2\t371716\t2\t371717\t2\t371760\t2\t371770\t2\t371776\t2\t37160\t2\t371839\t2\t371844\t2\t371150\t2\t371923\t2\t371924\t2\t371967\t2\t371243\t2\t371272\t2\t3711403\t2\t3711404\t2\t371339\t2\t371347\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371371\t2\t371382\t2\t371387\t2\t371",

    "words": "Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have verylittle verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specificrequirements for information.  Such information is needed to properlydesign or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statementsof requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinionrather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have beenobtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there areextremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine andstate user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests anapproach or point of view that might help this situation by providing amethod of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a moreconvenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes severalexamples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data thatsupport these statements.In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirementsof workers in the field of science and technology, with no seriousattempt made to include workers in other fields.

The concept of information as used throughout thisbook is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most oftenrecorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numericdata.Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary butinclude one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data basepublishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storageand retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved incomputerized services, micrographic applications, selective disseminationof information (SDI), and networking.Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services areprinted commercial and legal services, traditional academic and speciallibraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributorswithin the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing andabstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limitedto such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, andacquisitions..X453\t2\t376459\t2\t376459\t2\t376459\t2\t376524\t2\t376525\t2\t376527\t2\t376529\t2\t376530\t2\t376534\t2\t376629\t2\t376633\t2\t376635\t2\t376636\t2\t376637\t2\t376642\t2\t376648\t2\t376652\t2\t37618\t2\t37618\t2\t376702\t2\t376703\t2\t376730\t2\t376730\t2\t376732\t2\t376733\t2\t376734\t2\t376736\t2\t376826\t2\t376827\t2\t376877\t2\t376879\t2\t376123\t2\t376127\t2\t376127\t2\t376128\t2\t376129\t2\t376130\t2\t376145\t2\t376145\t2\t376145\t2\t376191\t2\t376910\t2\t376935\t2\t3761006\t2\t3761049\t2\t3761080\t2\t3761143\t2\t3761145\t2\t3761198\t2\t3761227\t2\t3761370\t2\t3761372\t2\t3761376\t2\t3761383\t2\t3761384\t2\t3761396\t2\t3761396\t2\t3761396\t2\t3761396\t2\t3761403\t2\t3761457\t2\t376339\t2\t376357\t2\t376370\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376376\t2\t376387\t2\t376",

    "words": "Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of acollection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of themore traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexingis that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlookedin a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilationof citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexingmethods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are notvulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms usedin subject indexes..X505\t2\t377560\t2\t377573\t2\t377605\t2\t377613\t2\t377618\t2\t377632\t2\t377632\t2\t377632\t2\t377635\t2\t377667\t2\t37719\t2\t37737\t2\t37739\t2\t37740\t2\t37741\t2\t37747\t2\t37747\t2\t377748\t2\t377749\t2\t377751\t2\t377764\t2\t377764\t2\t377765\t2\t377777\t2\t377778\t2\t377782\t2\t37788\t2\t37797\t2\t377804\t2\t377805\t2\t377893\t2\t377102\t2\t377103\t2\t377106\t2\t377952\t2\t377233\t2\t377253\t2\t3771016\t2\t3771061\t2\t3771085\t2\t3771086\t2\t3771087\t2\t3771087\t2\t3771182\t2\t3771200\t2\t3771234\t2\t3771274\t2\t3771274\t2\t3771274\t2\t3771277\t2\t3771277\t2\t3771277\t2\t3771278\t2\t3771278\t2\t3771280\t2\t3771280\t2\t3771285\t2\t3771285\t2\t3771287\t2\t3771301\t2\t3771301\t2\t3771302\t2\t3771302\t2\t3771302\t2\t3771304\t2\t3771313\t2\t3771313\t2\t3771313\t2\t3771338\t2\t3771344\t2\t3771347\t2\t3771380\t2\t3771428\t2\t3771444\t2\t3771444\t2\t377313\t2\t377359\t2\t377377\t2\t377377\t2\t377377\t2\t377377\t2\t377377\t2\t377377\t2\t377377\t2\t377379\t2\t377395\t2\t377",

This has stimulated the development of digitalcomputers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramaticincrease in the volume of data communicated between suchmachines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in somecases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of eithererror-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code inthe terminal devices.

That is, intelligence systems or fact retrievalsystems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing,an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape..X408\t2\t381445\t2\t381448\t2\t381452\t2\t381456\t2\t381458\t2\t381468\t2\t381484\t2\t381490\t2\t381490\t2\t381491\t2\t381496\t2\t381506\t2\t381511\t2\t381514\t2\t381514\t2\t381516\t2\t381518\t2\t381518\t2\t381521\t2\t381522\t2\t381523\t2\t381526\t2\t381527\t2\t381528\t2\t381529\t2\t381554\t2\t381575\t2\t381575\t2\t381579\t2\t381591\t2\t381591\t2\t381591\t2\t381591\t2\t381592\t2\t381595\t2\t381595\t2\t381599\t2\t381603\t2\t381610\t2\t381615\t2\t381615\t2\t381615\t2\t381619\t2\t381620\t2\t381621\t2\t381625\t2\t381625\t2\t381626\t2\t381630\t2\t381636\t2\t381639\t2\t381646\t2\t381676\t2\t381696\t2\t38128\t2\t381700\t2\t381705\t2\t381707\t2\t381723\t2\t381723\t2\t381724\t2\t381727\t2\t381752\t2\t381752\t2\t381754\t2\t381779\t2\t381780\t2\t381785\t2\t381785\t2\t38174\t2\t38173\t2\t38183\t2\t381812\t2\t381817\t2\t381820\t2\t381822\t2\t381822\t2\t381822\t2\t381822\t2\t381824\t2\t381827\t2\t381829\t2\t381834\t2\t381860\t2\t381875\t2\t381895\t2\t381124\t2\t381125\t2\t381157\t2\t381165\t2\t381175\t2\t381907\t2\t381925\t2\t381957\t2\t381976\t2\t381986\t2\t381213\t2\t381224\t2\t381245\t2\t381273\t2\t381279\t2\t381288\t2\t381298\t2\t3811065\t2\t3811078\t2\t3811091\t2\t3811148\t2\t3811227\t2\t3811279\t2\t3811282\t2\t3811282\t2\t3811303\t2\t3811317\t2\t3811327\t2\t3811353\t2\t3811359\t2\t3811360\t2\t3811364\t2\t3811366\t2\t3811367\t2\t3811368\t2\t3811400\t2\t3811410\t2\t3811424\t2\t3811448\t2\t381331\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381381\t2\t381382\t2\t381382\t2\t381389\t2\t381",

The much more typical event is one in which the receiptof a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these twokinds of communication.

For documentation and information retrieval ingeneral, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing andmachine selection are also available.  That classification is ofvalue in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistencyand subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selectiondesigners of such retrieval systems find the need to introduceclassificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demandfor the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangementand cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensivelycultivated fields of knowledge.It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, thatthis guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depthclassification have been greatly developed during the past decade,and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than thetraditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.These developments have been reported mainly as research papersin a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarilydifficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.There is a need for a more simply written and more readilyavailable practical guide to the use of the newer techniques ofclassification..X434\t2\t388477\t2\t388501\t2\t388516\t2\t388558\t2\t388761\t2\t388149\t2\t388168\t2\t388258\t2\t388258\t2\t388263\t2\t3881066\t2\t3881162\t2\t3881162\t2\t3881164\t2\t3881164\t2\t3881175\t2\t3881231\t2\t3881259\t2\t3881309\t2\t3881391\t2\t3881413\t2\t3881413\t2\t3881414\t2\t3881448\t2\t3881448\t2\t388317\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388388\t2\t388",

Government expendituresfor research and development have increased from a modestannual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which werealmost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional productrepresented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledgewhose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  Thesophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products inwhich we engage today, which require vast research expenditures tofind the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or themost accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces anincrease in the national level of scientific and technological competencethat has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.

The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topicsas normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types ofautomata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  Theseautomata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linearbounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered indetail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludeswith certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties,computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars,stack automata, and decidability..X417\t2\t397417\t2\t397417\t2\t397430\t2\t397430\t2\t397430\t2\t397443\t2\t397443\t2\t397443\t2\t397455\t2\t397455\t2\t397455\t2\t397455\t2\t397464\t2\t397464\t2\t397464\t2\t397745\t2\t397745\t2\t397745\t2\t3971204\t2\t3971204\t2\t3971204\t2\t3971398\t2\t3971398\t2\t3971398\t2\t3971427\t2\t3971427\t2\t3971427\t2\t397396\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397397\t2\t397",

It has not yet been possible to take themore recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to theirscope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses arecommented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present acomplete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpartto the new version of transformational grammar.

The last chapter is intended for teachers.The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographicalguide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world.It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianshipstudents in the course of their project work, on replies to aquestionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world,and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over anumber of years..X407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407407\t2\t407323\t2\t407",

    "words": "The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians inresolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  Theintent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methodsavailable for the application of modern data processing to library operations.For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool toguide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniquesinto his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating himnot only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between dataprocessing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summaryof the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives andthe technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and,particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determiningthe choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always inthe context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems,as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of goodmanagement, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims toeducate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problemsof applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork hasalready been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried outanalyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and isdeveloping better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues aprocess that is already underway..X406\t2\t408406\t2\t408406\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408408\t2\t408435\t2\t408458\t2\t408471\t2\t408490\t2\t408492\t2\t408496\t2\t408497\t2\t408506\t2\t408507\t2\t408508\t2\t408510\t2\t408535\t2\t408548\t2\t408554\t2\t408554\t2\t408584\t2\t408591\t2\t408591\t2\t408592\t2\t408594\t2\t408604\t2\t408601\t2\t408607\t2\t408654\t2\t408686\t2\t40818\t2\t408723\t2\t408724\t2\t40874\t2\t40883\t2\t408834\t2\t408849\t2\t408850\t2\t408851\t2\t408857\t2\t408858\t2\t408859\t2\t408856\t2\t408860\t2\t408860\t2\t408861\t2\t408862\t2\t408865\t2\t408866\t2\t408867\t2\t408897\t2\t408114\t2\t408119\t2\t408177\t2\t408177\t2\t408178\t2\t408178\t2\t408178\t2\t408916\t2\t408916\t2\t408916\t2\t408925\t2\t408925\t2\t408925\t2\t408938\t2\t408948\t2\t408957\t2\t408959\t2\t408960\t2\t408962\t2\t408962\t2\t408964\t2\t408970\t2\t408974\t2\t408976\t2\t408976\t2\t408976\t2\t408976\t2\t408979\t2\t408979\t2\t408979\t2\t408980\t2\t408984\t2\t408986\t2\t408206\t2\t408206\t2\t408206\t2\t408207\t2\t408208\t2\t408208\t2\t408214\t2\t408218\t2\t408241\t2\t408243\t2\t408245\t2\t408245\t2\t408245\t2\t408245\t2\t408249\t2\t408249\t2\t408250\t2\t408253\t2\t408266\t2\t408273\t2\t408277\t2\t408279\t2\t408282\t2\t408287\t2\t408287\t2\t408287\t2\t408288\t2\t408291\t2\t4081005\t2\t4081007\t2\t4081007\t2\t4081007\t2\t4081007\t2\t4081007\t2\t4081012\t2\t4081012\t2\t4081013\t2\t4081033\t2\t4081035\t2\t4081042\t2\t4081084\t2\t4081087\t2\t4081148\t2\t4081227\t2\t4081248\t2\t4081317\t2\t4081317\t2\t4081317\t2\t4081317\t2\t4081327\t2\t4081327\t2\t4081353\t2\t4081358\t2\t4081359\t2\t4081360\t2\t4081400\t2\t4081400\t2\t4081400\t2\t4081400\t2\t4081400\t2\t4081410\t2\t4081424\t2\t4081445\t2\t408331\t2\t408348\t2\t408348\t2\t408365\t2\t408374\t2\t408375\t2\t408381\t2\t408",

In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmedwith data from many sources, it is easy to understand why peopleare apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even intheir own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awarenessof a loss of relatedness to the world at large.

Similarly, long-term integrated activities extendingover periods of days or years receive no attention..X417\t2\t417417\t2\t417417\t2\t417417\t2\t417417\t2\t417417\t2\t417417\t2\t417430\t2\t417430\t2\t417430\t2\t417443\t2\t417443\t2\t417443\t2\t417443\t2\t417446\t2\t417455\t2\t417455\t2\t417455\t2\t417458\t2\t417464\t2\t417464\t2\t417464\t2\t417485\t2\t417514\t2\t417546\t2\t417546\t2\t417572\t2\t417572\t2\t417577\t2\t417579\t2\t417606\t2\t417608\t2\t417610\t2\t417611\t2\t417612\t2\t417615\t2\t417626\t2\t417640\t2\t417745\t2\t417745\t2\t417745\t2\t417168\t2\t417172\t2\t417191\t2\t417194\t2\t417902\t2\t417902\t2\t417212\t2\t417274\t2\t4171033\t2\t4171046\t2\t4171084\t2\t4171204\t2\t4171204\t2\t4171204\t2\t4171279\t2\t4171327\t2\t4171387\t2\t4171387\t2\t4171399\t2\t4171398\t2\t4171398\t2\t4171398\t2\t4171427\t2\t4171427\t2\t4171427\t2\t417317\t2\t417332\t2\t417343\t2\t417397\t2\t417397\t2\t417397\t2\t417",

They determinealso the quality of its successive generations of management.Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibilityand the hope of future progress.  The key question for top managementis:  \"What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) aboutthe most effective way to manage people?\"  From the answer to thisquestion flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in ourdiscussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to manyother questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks toachieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  Itwill be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptionsabout the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate..X4\t2\t418401\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418418\t2\t418549\t2\t418578\t2\t418768\t2\t418774\t2\t418823\t2\t418842\t2\t418843\t2\t418844\t2\t418173\t2\t418925\t2\t418227\t2\t418270\t2\t418285\t2\t418293\t2\t418296\t2\t418298\t2\t418298\t2\t4181015\t2\t4181041\t2\t4181069\t2\t4181069\t2\t4181069\t2\t4181069\t2\t4181070\t2\t4181070\t2\t4181070\t2\t4181070\t2\t4181070\t2\t4181150\t2\t4181150\t2\t4181186\t2\t4181187\t2\t4181205\t2\t4181205\t2\t4181214\t2\t4181214\t2\t4181233\t2\t4181454\t2\t4181455\t2\t4181455\t2\t4181455\t2\t418301\t2\t418302\t2\t418306\t2\t418",

Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisionallaboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support thea priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces ofinformation are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need,problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means ortechnique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on theopportunity..

An experiment wasconducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company tomeasure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certaintypes of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shapeof polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of successforecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators thanseveral commonly used project status measures.  These results tendto support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models thatare based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be usedby management to aid in early identification of eventually failingprojects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding..X423\t2\t427423\t2\t427424\t2\t427425\t2\t427425\t2\t427426\t2\t427427\t2\t427427\t2\t427427\t2\t427427\t2\t427427\t2\t427427\t2\t427428\t2\t427561\t2\t4271039\t2\t4271039\t2\t4271040\t2\t4271449\t2\t427",

    "words": "Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gonebeyond the usual slapdash use of the words \"relevant\" and \"relevance,\" andhave attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partiallysucceed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/contentrelevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification hasvalidity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a lessprecise language; for example, in defining \"second order noise,\" she uses theambiguous phrase \"a formally relevant document which is not really relevant\" -presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need ofthe enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, \"no account is taken ofthe subjective relevance (pertinence).\"  Yet this is surely the true aim of thesystem..X444\t2\t447444\t2\t447445\t2\t447445\t2\t447445\t2\t447447\t2\t447447\t2\t447447\t2\t447447\t2\t447447\t2\t447447\t2\t447447\t2\t447449\t2\t447449\t2\t447449\t2\t447474\t2\t447486\t2\t447514\t2\t447523\t2\t447532\t2\t447532\t2\t447554\t2\t447557\t2\t447574\t2\t447625\t2\t447625\t2\t447639\t2\t447660\t2\t44715\t2\t44729\t2\t44735\t2\t44742\t2\t44743\t2\t447740\t2\t447741\t2\t447752\t2\t447762\t2\t447764\t2\t44758\t2\t44770\t2\t44784\t2\t447803\t2\t447806\t2\t447893\t2\t447152\t2\t4471016\t2\t4471030\t2\t4471045\t2\t4471084\t2\t4471195\t2\t4471201\t2\t4471235\t2\t4471281\t2\t4471285\t2\t4471319\t2\t4471327\t2\t4471386\t2\t447313\t2\t447",

Theclusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases todetermine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results..Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations wereobtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performancewere achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in theretrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can beobtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clustersand adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their usein an operational system..

Some of thefundamental characteristics of social science research and itsliterature which have a bearing upon investigations of informationneeds and requirements are considered in the first part of Chapter3, and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studiesin the social sciences.  Other relevant material about the use madeof information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches..X4\t2\t4569\t2\t456439\t2\t456440\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456456\t2\t456458\t2\t456514\t2\t456533\t2\t456533\t2\t456545\t2\t456554\t2\t456560\t2\t456575\t2\t456579\t2\t456591\t2\t456595\t2\t456599\t2\t456603\t2\t456607\t2\t456615\t2\t456619\t2\t456620\t2\t456621\t2\t456625\t2\t456630\t2\t45632\t2\t45648\t2\t45648\t2\t45648\t2\t456752\t2\t456760\t2\t456768\t2\t456772\t2\t456774\t2\t456780\t2\t456783\t2\t456793\t2\t456793\t2\t456799\t2\t45695\t2\t45696\t2\t45698\t2\t45698\t2\t456803\t2\t456811\t2\t456816\t2\t456822\t2\t456837\t2\t456102\t2\t456104\t2\t456106\t2\t456110\t2\t456111\t2\t456111\t2\t456112\t2\t456113\t2\t456131\t2\t456137\t2\t456137\t2\t456163\t2\t456170\t2\t456175\t2\t456900\t2\t456900\t2\t456907\t2\t456913\t2\t456961\t2\t456962\t2\t456964\t2\t456968\t2\t456207\t2\t456224\t2\t456298\t2\t4561030\t2\t4561032\t2\t4561032\t2\t4561045\t2\t4561056\t2\t4561056\t2\t4561062\t2\t4561068\t2\t4561203\t2\t4561238\t2\t4561254\t2\t4561285\t2\t4561287\t2\t4561291\t2\t4561296\t2\t4561321\t2\t4561338\t2\t4561340\t2\t4561344\t2\t4561346\t2\t4561347\t2\t4561407\t2\t4561445\t2\t456311\t2\t456312\t2\t456345\t2\t456381\t2\t456",

    "words": "In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science tokeep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, thepublication of collected papers, like the estate of holymatrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have beenconsidered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respectedfriend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragementalone overcame that distaste which most of us feelfor our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought thisfirst volume to the point of no return.  It is true that theseexploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionablyawkward selection of publications for anyone wanting tofollow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them werewritten for specific occasions, each of which demanded somerehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resultingrepetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasionalexceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated onlyat the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solutionadopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passagesintact, offsetting in small print those that can be skippedwithout loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where somecomment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword orpostscript to the original papers, the passages added havebeen italicized..X3\t2\t457445\t2\t457457\t2\t457457\t2\t457457\t2\t457457\t2\t457457\t2\t457467\t2\t457604\t2\t457660\t2\t457665\t2\t45758\t2\t45785\t2\t457803\t2\t457911\t2\t457274\t2\t4571037\t2\t4571045\t2\t4571309\t2\t457361\t2\t457",

We hope thatthis book may have some value for all students of library and informationscience..X400\t2\t459433\t2\t459450\t2\t459451\t2\t459452\t2\t459458\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459459\t2\t459468\t2\t459475\t2\t459484\t2\t459492\t2\t459493\t2\t459505\t2\t459508\t2\t459511\t2\t459512\t2\t459514\t2\t459514\t2\t459518\t2\t459520\t2\t459523\t2\t459524\t2\t459524\t2\t459525\t2\t459525\t2\t459526\t2\t459526\t2\t459527\t2\t459529\t2\t459529\t2\t459530\t2\t459530\t2\t459532\t2\t459534\t2\t459534\t2\t459534\t2\t459546\t2\t459546\t2\t459548\t2\t459553\t2\t459575\t2\t459579\t2\t459579\t2\t459594\t2\t459594\t2\t459594\t2\t459598\t2\t459599\t2\t459602\t2\t459603\t2\t459604\t2\t459606\t2\t459606\t2\t459609\t2\t459610\t2\t459611\t2\t459611\t2\t459612\t2\t459612\t2\t459621\t2\t459625\t2\t459625\t2\t459625\t2\t459626\t2\t459626\t2\t459627\t2\t459630\t2\t459630\t2\t459633\t2\t459635\t2\t459636\t2\t459636\t2\t459637\t2\t459637\t2\t459642\t2\t459642\t2\t459642\t2\t459643\t2\t459646\t2\t459646\t2\t459646\t2\t459648\t2\t459648\t2\t459650\t2\t459692\t2\t459692\t2\t459696\t2\t459699\t2\t45910\t2\t45918\t2\t45918\t2\t45918\t2\t459702\t2\t459702\t2\t459702\t2\t459703\t2\t459703\t2\t459705\t2\t459708\t2\t459726\t2\t459727\t2\t459728\t2\t459728\t2\t459730\t2\t459730\t2\t459731\t2\t459731\t2\t459732\t2\t459732\t2\t459732\t2\t459733\t2\t459733\t2\t459734\t2\t459734\t2\t459734\t2\t459736\t2\t459736\t2\t459736\t2\t459738\t2\t459739\t2\t459740\t2\t459740\t2\t459741\t2\t459742\t2\t459742\t2\t459742\t2\t459743\t2\t459743\t2\t459744\t2\t459754\t2\t459755\t2\t45961\t2\t459814\t2\t459817\t2\t459820\t2\t459820\t2\t459823\t2\t459825\t2\t459826\t2\t459826\t2\t459826\t2\t459826\t2\t459826\t2\t459826\t2\t459826\t2\t459827\t2\t459827\t2\t459827\t2\t459827\t2\t459828\t2\t459877\t2\t459879\t2\t459879\t2\t459879\t2\t459879\t2\t459883\t2\t459883\t2\t459883\t2\t459885\t2\t459885\t2\t459114\t2\t459120\t2\t459123\t2\t459124\t2\t459124\t2\t459127\t2\t459127\t2\t459127\t2\t459127\t2\t459128\t2\t459129\t2\t459129\t2\t459135\t2\t459145\t2\t459145\t2\t459145\t2\t459169\t2\t459175\t2\t459190\t2\t459190\t2\t459190\t2\t459191\t2\t459191\t2\t459197\t2\t459925\t2\t459947\t2\t459948\t2\t459972\t2\t459990\t2\t459211\t2\t459214\t2\t459218\t2\t459225\t2\t459243\t2\t459244\t2\t459244\t2\t459245\t2\t459274\t2\t459289\t2\t459291\t2\t4591004\t2\t4591017\t2\t4591035\t2\t4591035\t2\t4591045\t2\t4591058\t2\t4591073\t2\t4591078\t2\t4591080\t2\t4591089\t2\t4591091\t2\t4591143\t2\t4591146\t2\t4591146\t2\t4591198\t2\t4591207\t2\t4591230\t2\t4591257\t2\t4591263\t2\t4591264\t2\t4591284\t2\t4591297\t2\t4591303\t2\t4591303\t2\t4591327\t2\t4591356\t2\t4591356\t2\t4591357\t2\t4591364\t2\t4591368\t2\t4591368\t2\t4591368\t2\t4591370\t2\t4591370\t2\t4591370\t2\t4591372\t2\t4591372\t2\t4591372\t2\t4591373\t2\t4591374\t2\t4591374\t2\t4591374\t2\t4591374\t2\t4591375\t2\t4591375\t2\t4591375\t2\t4591376\t2\t4591376\t2\t4591377\t2\t4591377\t2\t4591383\t2\t4591390\t2\t4591392\t2\t4591396\t2\t4591396\t2\t4591396\t2\t4591396\t2\t4591402\t2\t4591405\t2\t4591414\t2\t4591448\t2\t4591448\t2\t459304\t2\t459305\t2\t459306\t2\t459307\t2\t459312\t2\t459320\t2\t459321\t2\t459330\t2\t459345\t2\t459357\t2\t459357\t2\t459358\t2\t459376\t2\t459376\t2\t459376\t2\t459378\t2\t459385\t2\t459394\t2\t459",

    "words": "Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of informationretrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since thedetermination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documentswhich are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to thatquery, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally validevaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevanceassessments on the average recall and precision values used to measureretrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in informationscience for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in therelevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recalland precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precisiondata may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for manydistinct user classes...X444\t2\t486445\t2\t486447\t2\t486448\t2\t486449\t2\t486474\t2\t486480\t2\t486483\t2\t486484\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486486\t2\t486487\t2\t486488\t2\t486491\t2\t486493\t2\t486503\t2\t486507\t2\t486509\t2\t486510\t2\t486512\t2\t486517\t2\t486520\t2\t486522\t2\t486527\t2\t486528\t2\t486531\t2\t486532\t2\t486565\t2\t486566\t2\t486581\t2\t486596\t2\t486603\t2\t486608\t2\t486625\t2\t486633\t2\t486659\t2\t486660\t2\t48628\t2\t48628\t2\t48629\t2\t48635\t2\t48642\t2\t48643\t2\t48643\t2\t48645\t2\t486715\t2\t486720\t2\t486748\t2\t486754\t2\t486762\t2\t486764\t2\t48651\t2\t48658\t2\t48650\t2\t486781\t2\t486785\t2\t486786\t2\t486787\t2\t486788\t2\t486789\t2\t486790\t2\t486791\t2\t486795\t2\t48669\t2\t48670\t2\t48671\t2\t48671\t2\t48672\t2\t48674\t2\t48675\t2\t48675\t2\t48677\t2\t48677\t2\t48678\t2\t48679\t2\t48679\t2\t48673\t2\t48681\t2\t48682\t2\t48683\t2\t48684\t2\t48686\t2\t486805\t2\t486809\t2\t486810\t2\t486812\t2\t486813\t2\t486814\t2\t486817\t2\t486824\t2\t486825\t2\t486853\t2\t486893\t2\t486894\t2\t486149\t2\t486153\t2\t486156\t2\t486168\t2\t486175\t2\t486175\t2\t486176\t2\t486925\t2\t486984\t2\t486211\t2\t486212\t2\t486245\t2\t486277\t2\t486279\t2\t486280\t2\t4861016\t2\t4861030\t2\t4861045\t2\t4861051\t2\t4861084\t2\t4861195\t2\t4861201\t2\t4861235\t2\t4861255\t2\t4861277\t2\t4861280\t2\t4861281\t2\t4861285\t2\t4861285\t2\t4861287\t2\t4861294\t2\t4861327\t2\t4861414\t2\t4861419\t2\t4861427\t2\t486315\t2\t486382\t2\t486",

While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitivebasis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for definingand selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection areproposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification andexclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of\"good index terms\", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithmsfor their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on theprinciple of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was notachieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms..Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm couldsuccessfully eliminate the useless phrases..

Since the user is the only person competentto make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that theselection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrievalerror.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measuresof performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of thesystem to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failureto retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It isdifficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage inbeing provided with irrelevant citations.

This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in thefield of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem isacute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these twosystems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the otherpolicy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and socialdevelopment.An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will bedescribed, and an array of figures representing actual or theoreticaloperating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, thesefigures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in otherthan general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a systemmay have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assistedinformation systems may make sense within individual institutionalenvironments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linkingvarious collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operatemore efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-linenetworks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibilityof having access at a reasonable price to large information stores..X408\t2\t497482\t2\t497488\t2\t497489\t2\t497490\t2\t497490\t2\t497490\t2\t497491\t2\t497491\t2\t497491\t2\t497492\t2\t497492\t2\t497492\t2\t497492\t2\t497495\t2\t497495\t2\t497496\t2\t497496\t2\t497496\t2\t497497\t2\t497497\t2\t497497\t2\t497497\t2\t497497\t2\t497493\t2\t497499\t2\t497494\t2\t497498\t2\t497500\t2\t497506\t2\t497507\t2\t497508\t2\t497510\t2\t497548\t2\t497581\t2\t497581\t2\t497583\t2\t497584\t2\t497584\t2\t497586\t2\t497591\t2\t497594\t2\t497604\t2\t497601\t2\t497607\t2\t497659\t2\t49727\t2\t49738\t2\t497795\t2\t49774\t2\t49783\t2\t49784\t2\t497801\t2\t497866\t2\t497867\t2\t497158\t2\t497172\t2\t497986\t2\t497218\t2\t497243\t2\t497253\t2\t4971035\t2\t4971042\t2\t4971087\t2\t4971207\t2\t4971294\t2\t4971294\t2\t4971327\t2\t497375\t2\t497",

    "words": "To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in thecourse of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions,been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by someobjective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-typecriteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance thestate-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriatefor operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion thattakes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem ofoperating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexingpossible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level ofeffectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human,machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type ofcriterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approachis described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and ofeffectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how toreduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems ofdefining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discretesteps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans andsmall-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines...X446\t2\t500446\t2\t500488\t2\t500489\t2\t500489\t2\t500490\t2\t500491\t2\t500492\t2\t500495\t2\t500496\t2\t500497\t2\t500493\t2\t500493\t2\t500499\t2\t500499\t2\t500499\t2\t500494\t2\t500500\t2\t500500\t2\t500500\t2\t500500\t2\t500500\t2\t500517\t2\t500517\t2\t500522\t2\t500527\t2\t500527\t2\t500576\t2\t500581\t2\t500583\t2\t500584\t2\t500586\t2\t500659\t2\t50038\t2\t500795\t2\t50084\t2\t500801\t2\t500830\t2\t500158\t2\t500174\t2\t500175\t2\t500176\t2\t500986\t2\t5001294\t2\t5001317\t2\t5001327\t2\t5001400\t2\t500332\t2\t500",

Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature,automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manualindexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived,our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only thecitation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic linksamong papers..

Also, thecomputer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount ofinternal memory..The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program thatmeets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automaticallyexpressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the naturalspelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity forextensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string invertedindex greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables longstrings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage..Creation of \"reduced\" files and tables is an important feature of a program; itallows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designedto use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time...X416\t2\t511416\t2\t511416\t2\t511416\t2\t511416\t2\t511440\t2\t511442\t2\t511442\t2\t511442\t2\t511442\t2\t511442\t2\t511442\t2\t511448\t2\t511450\t2\t511450\t2\t511450\t2\t511450\t2\t511450\t2\t511450\t2\t511451\t2\t511452\t2\t511452\t2\t511452\t2\t511453\t2\t511459\t2\t511467\t2\t511468\t2\t511468\t2\t511484\t2\t511484\t2\t511492\t2\t511495\t2\t511495\t2\t511495\t2\t511495\t2\t511495\t2\t511495\t2\t511506\t2\t511508\t2\t511508\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511511\t2\t511512\t2\t511512\t2\t511514\t2\t511514\t2\t511516\t2\t511517\t2\t511518\t2\t511518\t2\t511520\t2\t511520\t2\t511521\t2\t511521\t2\t511521\t2\t511522\t2\t511523\t2\t511523\t2\t511523\t2\t511524\t2\t511524\t2\t511524\t2\t511524\t2\t511524\t2\t511525\t2\t511526\t2\t511526\t2\t511526\t2\t511527\t2\t511528\t2\t511528\t2\t511529\t2\t511529\t2\t511530\t2\t511534\t2\t511546\t2\t511553\t2\t511563\t2\t511565\t2\t511565\t2\t511565\t2\t511567\t2\t511567\t2\t511567\t2\t511575\t2\t511576\t2\t511579\t2\t511580\t2\t511594\t2\t511603\t2\t511604\t2\t511604\t2\t511606\t2\t511609\t2\t511609\t2\t511610\t2\t511610\t2\t511611\t2\t511612\t2\t511612\t2\t511615\t2\t511619\t2\t511622\t2\t511623\t2\t511625\t2\t511625\t2\t511626\t2\t511626\t2\t511629\t2\t511630\t2\t511631\t2\t511632\t2\t511633\t2\t511636\t2\t511636\t2\t511637\t2\t511642\t2\t511648\t2\t511650\t2\t511692\t2\t511696\t2\t511699\t2\t511699\t2\t51118\t2\t51119\t2\t51144\t2\t511700\t2\t511700\t2\t511700\t2\t511703\t2\t511705\t2\t511705\t2\t511705\t2\t511707\t2\t511707\t2\t511708\t2\t511723\t2\t511726\t2\t511726\t2\t511727\t2\t511727\t2\t511727\t2\t511728\t2\t511728\t2\t511729\t2\t511730\t2\t511731\t2\t511731\t2\t511732\t2\t511733\t2\t511734\t2\t511736\t2\t511738\t2\t511739\t2\t511740\t2\t511741\t2\t511742\t2\t511743\t2\t511744\t2\t511754\t2\t511754\t2\t511755\t2\t51157\t2\t511791\t2\t511791\t2\t511812\t2\t511812\t2\t511813\t2\t511814\t2\t511817\t2\t511820\t2\t511820\t2\t511822\t2\t511824\t2\t511826\t2\t511827\t2\t511835\t2\t511835\t2\t511851\t2\t511851\t2\t511856\t2\t511862\t2\t511862\t2\t511866\t2\t511867\t2\t511870\t2\t511872\t2\t511873\t2\t511875\t2\t511875\t2\t511875\t2\t511875\t2\t511879\t2\t511883\t2\t511894\t2\t511124\t2\t511124\t2\t511125\t2\t511125\t2\t511127\t2\t511129\t2\t511145\t2\t511165\t2\t511190\t2\t511191\t2\t511197\t2\t511211\t2\t511211\t2\t511214\t2\t511218\t2\t511228\t2\t511228\t2\t511228\t2\t511243\t2\t5111004\t2\t5111035\t2\t5111078\t2\t5111078\t2\t5111089\t2\t5111089\t2\t5111091\t2\t5111091\t2\t5111143\t2\t5111194\t2\t5111194\t2\t5111194\t2\t5111196\t2\t5111199\t2\t5111199\t2\t5111199\t2\t5111207\t2\t5111264\t2\t5111264\t2\t5111297\t2\t5111302\t2\t5111303\t2\t5111303\t2\t5111303\t2\t5111327\t2\t5111356\t2\t5111362\t2\t5111364\t2\t5111364\t2\t5111366\t2\t5111366\t2\t5111367\t2\t5111367\t2\t5111368\t2\t5111368\t2\t5111368\t2\t5111370\t2\t5111372\t2\t5111373\t2\t5111374\t2\t5111375\t2\t5111376\t2\t5111377\t2\t5111396\t2\t5111396\t2\t5111398\t2\t511307\t2\t511316\t2\t511318\t2\t511318\t2\t511321\t2\t511321\t2\t511324\t2\t511324\t2\t511329\t2\t511329\t2\t511329\t2\t511329\t2\t511329\t2\t511329\t2\t511330\t2\t511359\t2\t511378\t2\t511378\t2\t511381\t2\t511",

The center was designed to meet user needs by providing avariety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and ahigh degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 softwaresystem was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSChave run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All databases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employsa directory and character string type of the structure..User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic withany degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base;search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, orweight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile andmonitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequencylist and KLIC indexes..Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, andimprove Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,personnel functions and services..

The system, which permits thefree text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from EpilepsyAbstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases andStroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centersin the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs forinformation..

Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission ofa concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with twointerstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, inorder to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposedwhich could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the storedinformation and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the formof linear or string display..

After 8 cycles thecomputer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent ofdocuments that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basisof subject content..A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of thetechnique indicated...X446\t2\t522448\t2\t522448\t2\t522452\t2\t522480\t2\t522483\t2\t522484\t2\t522484\t2\t522486\t2\t522488\t2\t522491\t2\t522493\t2\t522499\t2\t522500\t2\t522503\t2\t522507\t2\t522509\t2\t522510\t2\t522511\t2\t522512\t2\t522516\t2\t522517\t2\t522517\t2\t522518\t2\t522520\t2\t522521\t2\t522522\t2\t522522\t2\t522522\t2\t522522\t2\t522522\t2\t522523\t2\t522526\t2\t522527\t2\t522527\t2\t522527\t2\t522528\t2\t522528\t2\t522529\t2\t522530\t2\t522531\t2\t522565\t2\t522566\t2\t522575\t2\t522576\t2\t522581\t2\t522596\t2\t522603\t2\t522608\t2\t522610\t2\t522615\t2\t522625\t2\t522626\t2\t522627\t2\t522628\t2\t522633\t2\t522636\t2\t522659\t2\t522700\t2\t522705\t2\t522707\t2\t522715\t2\t522727\t2\t522754\t2\t522754\t2\t52251\t2\t522790\t2\t52269\t2\t52271\t2\t52277\t2\t52279\t2\t522805\t2\t522809\t2\t522810\t2\t522812\t2\t522812\t2\t522813\t2\t522814\t2\t522817\t2\t522817\t2\t522824\t2\t522824\t2\t522825\t2\t522830\t2\t522873\t2\t522874\t2\t522875\t2\t522875\t2\t522876\t2\t522892\t2\t522894\t2\t522124\t2\t522125\t2\t522141\t2\t522165\t2\t522168\t2\t522175\t2\t522175\t2\t522176\t2\t522176\t2\t522941\t2\t522994\t2\t522995\t2\t522997\t2\t522996\t2\t522998\t2\t522299\t2\t5221051\t2\t5221079\t2\t5221153\t2\t5221189\t2\t5221251\t2\t5221294\t2\t5221303\t2\t5221327\t2\t5221327\t2\t5221351\t2\t5221364\t2\t5221366\t2\t5221367\t2\t5221368\t2\t5221396\t2\t5221419\t2\t5221420\t2\t5221427\t2\t5221434\t2\t5221435\t2\t5221442\t2\t522315\t2\t522333\t2\t522381\t2\t522382\t2\t522",

SUPARSwas an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectivenessdata of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, twomeasures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed indollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must beexpended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was anestimate of the recall ratio..To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in whichexperts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queriesfrom written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with thelist of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with informationproblems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before eachof the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are notedbelow..(1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) havebetter cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegantsearching operators..(2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably toimproving the cost-performance of the system..(3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences amongusers of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operationand evaluation of retrieval systems..

If he delegates his literature search he should alwaysbe aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. Thisprevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him consciousof the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannotdispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. Hewill also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods neededfor operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with themethods sufficient for his personal file..The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing,operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survivalpower, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character offundamental notions such as \"information\" and \"order\".. This gives him a betterunderstanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations instorage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts tomake such operations more \"objective\" and formal..

These packages weredeveloped via suitable modification of modular system software to result inproducts tailored to user idiosyncracies..The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures,and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line,interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users..Implications for networking and resource-sharing, focusing uponcost-effectiveness and performance measures, are also discussed...X439\t2\t528440\t2\t528448\t2\t528448\t2\t528452\t2\t528452\t2\t528453\t2\t528453\t2\t528467\t2\t528468\t2\t528480\t2\t528483\t2\t528484\t2\t528484\t2\t528484\t2\t528486\t2\t528488\t2\t528491\t2\t528495\t2\t528493\t2\t528503\t2\t528506\t2\t528507\t2\t528508\t2\t528508\t2\t528509\t2\t528510\t2\t528511\t2\t528511\t2\t528512\t2\t528512\t2\t528514\t2\t528516\t2\t528517\t2\t528517\t2\t528518\t2\t528520\t2\t528520\t2\t528521\t2\t528521\t2\t528522\t2\t528522\t2\t528523\t2\t528523\t2\t528523\t2\t528524\t2\t528526\t2\t528526\t2\t528526\t2\t528526\t2\t528527\t2\t528527\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528528\t2\t528529\t2\t528531\t2\t528534\t2\t528546\t2\t528565\t2\t528566\t2\t528575\t2\t528576\t2\t528579\t2\t528580\t2\t528581\t2\t528594\t2\t528596\t2\t528603\t2\t528604\t2\t528606\t2\t528608\t2\t528609\t2\t528610\t2\t528612\t2\t528612\t2\t528614\t2\t528615\t2\t528619\t2\t528622\t2\t528623\t2\t528624\t2\t528625\t2\t528626\t2\t528626\t2\t528629\t2\t528631\t2\t528632\t2\t528633\t2\t528633\t2\t528636\t2\t528637\t2\t528659\t2\t528699\t2\t52818\t2\t528700\t2\t528700\t2\t528705\t2\t528705\t2\t528707\t2\t528707\t2\t528715\t2\t528723\t2\t528726\t2\t528727\t2\t528727\t2\t528728\t2\t528729\t2\t528730\t2\t528731\t2\t528754\t2\t528754\t2\t528754\t2\t52851\t2\t528790\t2\t52869\t2\t52871\t2\t52877\t2\t52879\t2\t528805\t2\t528809\t2\t528810\t2\t528812\t2\t528812\t2\t528812\t2\t528813\t2\t528813\t2\t528814\t2\t528814\t2\t528817\t2\t528817\t2\t528818\t2\t528820\t2\t528822\t2\t528824\t2\t528824\t2\t528825\t2\t528826\t2\t528830\t2\t528866\t2\t528870\t2\t528872\t2\t528873\t2\t528875\t2\t528894\t2\t528119\t2\t528122\t2\t528124\t2\t528125\t2\t528125\t2\t528145\t2\t528165\t2\t528168\t2\t528175\t2\t528176\t2\t528940\t2\t528211\t2\t5281051\t2\t5281078\t2\t5281089\t2\t5281091\t2\t5281143\t2\t5281143\t2\t5281247\t2\t5281264\t2\t5281264\t2\t5281294\t2\t5281302\t2\t5281303\t2\t5281303\t2\t5281327\t2\t5281327\t2\t5281364\t2\t5281366\t2\t5281366\t2\t5281367\t2\t5281367\t2\t5281367\t2\t5281368\t2\t5281368\t2\t5281374\t2\t5281396\t2\t5281419\t2\t5281427\t2\t5281427\t2\t5281435\t2\t5281436\t2\t528300\t2\t528315\t2\t528332\t2\t528365\t2\t528378\t2\t528381\t2\t528382\t2\t528394\t2\t528",

It isfrom these predicates that the characteristics of thecorresponding concepts can be derived.  Commoncharacteristics in different concepts lead torelations between concepts, which relations in turn arefactors for the formation of concept systems.Different kinds of relationships as well as differentkinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointedout that an orderly supply of the elements forpropositions (information statements) on new knowledgerequires the construction and availability of suchconcept systems..X476\t2\t542477\t2\t542542\t2\t542542\t2\t542542\t2\t542542\t2\t542542\t2\t542758\t2\t542259\t2\t5421231\t2\t5421259\t2\t5421391\t2\t542",

How arescientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by thecirculation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the socialorganization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of thescientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain theinformation which they need for their research; and (c) studies of therelationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For themost part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have beenconducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, ashas been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbeyand Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack oftheory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of thestudies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any oneof these types of studies alone..

Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a thirdof the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loansare costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce theusefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loanfailures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lendinglibraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials andby determining in advance what library owns the item wanted..X550\t2\t550550\t2\t550550\t2\t550550\t2\t550550\t2\t55014\t2\t550153\t2\t550170\t2\t550223\t2\t550266\t2\t550271\t2\t5501019\t2\t5501028\t2\t5501086\t2\t5501090\t2\t5501424\t2\t550",

Theseunfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lendinglibraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besidesdisappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials.Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries checkin advance the lending policies before sending requests.The major elements determining whether or not librariesreceive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance arewhether the library lists unusual materials in union lists,especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OFSERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strongcollections in a subject field listed in library directories.Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type oflending library, the size of collection, budget for currentacquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopycharges, population density in neighboring states, proximityto other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings inthe National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers..X6\t2\t551403\t2\t551461\t2\t551551\t2\t551551\t2\t551551\t2\t551551\t2\t551551\t2\t55110\t2\t55110\t2\t551886\t2\t551887\t2\t551167\t2\t551942\t2\t551947\t2\t551232\t2\t5511058\t2\t5511059\t2\t5511060\t2\t5511258\t2\t5511305\t2\t5511306\t2\t5511390\t2\t551363\t2\t551",

For example, some experts would like to scrapscientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal.Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developedto enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively..X456\t2\t560505\t2\t560544\t2\t560544\t2\t560544\t2\t560545\t2\t560545\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560560\t2\t560573\t2\t560582\t2\t560589\t2\t560592\t2\t560602\t2\t560602\t2\t560605\t2\t560607\t2\t560614\t2\t560618\t2\t560618\t2\t560632\t2\t560632\t2\t560635\t2\t560646\t2\t560647\t2\t560652\t2\t560656\t2\t560667\t2\t560667\t2\t560685\t2\t56015\t2\t56019\t2\t56033\t2\t56037\t2\t56039\t2\t56039\t2\t56040\t2\t56047\t2\t56048\t2\t560722\t2\t560748\t2\t560749\t2\t560750\t2\t560751\t2\t560764\t2\t560765\t2\t560775\t2\t560777\t2\t560778\t2\t560782\t2\t560793\t2\t56088\t2\t56088\t2\t56089\t2\t56089\t2\t56089\t2\t56097\t2\t560800\t2\t560804\t2\t560805\t2\t560823\t2\t560827\t2\t560889\t2\t560888\t2\t560893\t2\t560101\t2\t560102\t2\t560102\t2\t560102\t2\t560103\t2\t560104\t2\t560105\t2\t560105\t2\t560105\t2\t560105\t2\t560105\t2\t560105\t2\t560106\t2\t560110\t2\t560110\t2\t560111\t2\t560111\t2\t560112\t2\t560113\t2\t560113\t2\t560113\t2\t560128\t2\t560147\t2\t560155\t2\t560157\t2\t560161\t2\t560161\t2\t560163\t2\t560163\t2\t560170\t2\t560919\t2\t560952\t2\t560233\t2\t560243\t2\t560253\t2\t5601003\t2\t5601010\t2\t5601016\t2\t5601030\t2\t5601030\t2\t5601044\t2\t5601048\t2\t5601050\t2\t5601061\t2\t5601062\t2\t5601062\t2\t5601063\t2\t5601081\t2\t5601085\t2\t5601086\t2\t5601087\t2\t5601082\t2\t5601082\t2\t5601088\t2\t5601182\t2\t5601186\t2\t5601188\t2\t5601200\t2\t5601256\t2\t5601256\t2\t5601270\t2\t5601274\t2\t5601277\t2\t5601278\t2\t5601280\t2\t5601284\t2\t5601285\t2\t5601285\t2\t5601285\t2\t5601286\t2\t5601287\t2\t5601287\t2\t5601287\t2\t5601290\t2\t5601291\t2\t5601291\t2\t5601291\t2\t5601291\t2\t5601293\t2\t5601293\t2\t5601294\t2\t5601295\t2\t5601296\t2\t5601296\t2\t5601297\t2\t5601298\t2\t5601300\t2\t5601300\t2\t5601301\t2\t5601302\t2\t5601304\t2\t5601308\t2\t5601312\t2\t5601313\t2\t5601315\t2\t5601315\t2\t5601319\t2\t5601334\t2\t5601338\t2\t5601339\t2\t5601340\t2\t5601340\t2\t5601344\t2\t5601344\t2\t5601346\t2\t5601346\t2\t5601346\t2\t5601346\t2\t5601347\t2\t5601347\t2\t5601347\t2\t5601380\t2\t5601386\t2\t5601386\t2\t5601404\t2\t5601408\t2\t5601428\t2\t5601444\t2\t5601444\t2\t5601445\t2\t560312\t2\t560313\t2\t560314\t2\t560356\t2\t560356\t2\t560356\t2\t560359\t2\t560377\t2\t560379\t2\t560384\t2\t560386\t2\t560395\t2\t560398\t2\t560",

    "words": "Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that theyignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the timebetween a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequentialdecision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) theresearch expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocableinvestment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today doesnot presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take intoaccount the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique ofdynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgetswhen the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained orunconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of thepatterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibittheir practical application are discussed...X423\t2\t561423\t2\t561423\t2\t561423\t2\t561423\t2\t561423\t2\t561424\t2\t561424\t2\t561424\t2\t561424\t2\t561424\t2\t561425\t2\t561425\t2\t561425\t2\t561425\t2\t561425\t2\t561426\t2\t561427\t2\t561428\t2\t561428\t2\t561436\t2\t561437\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t561561\t2\t5611036\t2\t5611039\t2\t5611039\t2\t5611040\t2\t5611040\t2\t5611449\t2\t561349\t2\t561",

    "words": "This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can finddocuments related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exactterms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of theirrelevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of astatistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of associationbetween pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations(entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and otherwords closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such avocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much morepowerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been availableheretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended listof request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regardfor their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer andarranged in the order of their relevance to the request...X419\t2\t562419\t2\t562419\t2\t562420\t2\t562421\t2\t562422\t2\t562458\t2\t562479\t2\t562485\t2\t562562\t2\t562562\t2\t562562\t2\t562562\t2\t562562\t2\t562562\t2\t562562\t2\t562564\t2\t562564\t2\t562564\t2\t562566\t2\t562566\t2\t562570\t2\t562659\t2\t562660\t2\t562660\t2\t562660\t2\t562661\t2\t562662\t2\t562662\t2\t562663\t2\t562663\t2\t562664\t2\t562664\t2\t562664\t2\t56226\t2\t56226\t2\t56226\t2\t56245\t2\t562769\t2\t562785\t2\t56278\t2\t562174\t2\t562175\t2\t562175\t2\t562179\t2\t5621044\t2\t5621087\t2\t5621144\t2\t5621154\t2\t5621218\t2\t5621218\t2\t5621279\t2\t5621327\t2\t562315\t2\t562321\t2\t562363\t2\t562",

It is thepurpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for theautomatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of theoriginal document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under whichvarious methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to developcriteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstractcan be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant tothe abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the mostsignificant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection andrejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentencereference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automaticabstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, calledthe Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functionsspecified for each WCL entry..

    "words": "This paper defines the relationship between linguisticsand information science in terms of a common interestin natural language.  The notion of automated processingof natural language - i.e., machine simulation ofthe language processing activities of a human - providesnovel possibilities for interaction between linguists,who have a theoretical interest in such activities,and information scientists, who have more practicalgoals, e.g. simulating the language processing activitiesof an indexer with a machine.The concept of a natural language information systemis introduced as a framework for reviewing automatedlanguage processing effort by computationallinguists and information scientists.  In terms of thisframework, the former have concentrated on automatingthe operations of the component for content analysisand representation, while the latter have emphasizedthe data management component.  The complementarynature of these developments allows thepostulation of an integrated approach to automatedlanguage processing.  This approach, which is outlinedin the final sections of the paper, incorporates currentnotions in linguistic theory and information science, aswell as design features of recent computational linguisticmodels..X417\t2\t572417\t2\t572443\t2\t572446\t2\t572446\t2\t572458\t2\t572473\t2\t572485\t2\t572485\t2\t572503\t2\t572516\t2\t572527\t2\t572546\t2\t572558\t2\t572565\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572572\t2\t572574\t2\t572577\t2\t572579\t2\t572590\t2\t572590\t2\t572595\t2\t572596\t2\t572608\t2\t572608\t2\t572615\t2\t572616\t2\t572619\t2\t572628\t2\t572632\t2\t572640\t2\t572664\t2\t572666\t2\t572683\t2\t57239\t2\t57257\t2\t57250\t2\t572773\t2\t572790\t2\t572795\t2\t57272\t2\t57275\t2\t572810\t2\t572812\t2\t572813\t2\t572814\t2\t572819\t2\t572830\t2\t572870\t2\t572894\t2\t572117\t2\t572160\t2\t572168\t2\t572168\t2\t572168\t2\t572172\t2\t572175\t2\t572176\t2\t572179\t2\t572180\t2\t572191\t2\t572194\t2\t572902\t2\t572902\t2\t572928\t2\t572958\t2\t572963\t2\t572990\t2\t572991\t2\t572212\t2\t572274\t2\t5721033\t2\t5721045\t2\t5721046\t2\t5721046\t2\t5721046\t2\t5721047\t2\t5721084\t2\t5721139\t2\t5721202\t2\t5721207\t2\t5721213\t2\t5721218\t2\t5721255\t2\t5721279\t2\t5721283\t2\t5721327\t2\t5721387\t2\t5721389\t2\t5721399\t2\t5721399\t2\t5721413\t2\t5721426\t2\t5721428\t2\t5721443\t2\t5721443\t2\t5721445\t2\t572317\t2\t572317\t2\t572320\t2\t572326\t2\t572329\t2\t572332\t2\t572",

A thorough discussion ofdecision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature,outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under thecases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statisticsare also discussed to show how prior information about the various documentsvia classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. Anexample problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and tocompare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with andwithout document classification information..Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to modelthe retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and todemonstrate the value of prior information via document classificationanalysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, anoverall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem,incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation,which allows one to better understand the contributions made by manyresearchers in this crucial area...X419\t2\t575441\t2\t575441\t2\t575448\t2\t575452\t2\t575456\t2\t575458\t2\t575459\t2\t575484\t2\t575511\t2\t575514\t2\t575516\t2\t575518\t2\t575518\t2\t575521\t2\t575522\t2\t575523\t2\t575526\t2\t575527\t2\t575528\t2\t575529\t2\t575531\t2\t575554\t2\t575575\t2\t575575\t2\t575575\t2\t575575\t2\t575575\t2\t575577\t2\t575577\t2\t575579\t2\t575591\t2\t575595\t2\t575599\t2\t575599\t2\t575603\t2\t575610\t2\t575615\t2\t575615\t2\t575619\t2\t575620\t2\t575621\t2\t575621\t2\t575625\t2\t575625\t2\t575626\t2\t575630\t2\t575630\t2\t575636\t2\t575644\t2\t575649\t2\t575660\t2\t575660\t2\t575692\t2\t575700\t2\t575705\t2\t575707\t2\t575727\t2\t575752\t2\t575752\t2\t575754\t2\t575780\t2\t575780\t2\t57575\t2\t57579\t2\t575812\t2\t575812\t2\t575817\t2\t575822\t2\t575824\t2\t575824\t2\t575875\t2\t575120\t2\t575124\t2\t575125\t2\t575128\t2\t575135\t2\t575165\t2\t575175\t2\t575907\t2\t575925\t2\t575956\t2\t575224\t2\t575244\t2\t575245\t2\t575291\t2\t575298\t2\t5751202\t2\t5751282\t2\t5751282\t2\t5751294\t2\t5751303\t2\t5751327\t2\t5751364\t2\t5751366\t2\t5751367\t2\t5751368\t2\t5751402\t2\t575315\t2\t575381\t2\t575381\t2\t575",

Federal CommunicationsCommission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developedby this group and is now operational..The level of performance of this program known as \"The CitationIdentifier\" is high.. In a recent computer run, The CitationIdentifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisionsof U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) andlocated correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and threefalse drops occurred..Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) wereidentified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identificationscontaining two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which somecitation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program (\"short hits\");and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly includedin the citations (\"long hits\").Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible andcan be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of textwas approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increasedby suitable changes in the computer program..An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,\"the Geddes decision\", \"the Southland Industries case\") is now in preparation...X420\t2\t581448\t2\t581480\t2\t581483\t2\t581484\t2\t581486\t2\t581488\t2\t581488\t2\t581488\t2\t581489\t2\t581489\t2\t581490\t2\t581490\t2\t581491\t2\t581491\t2\t581491\t2\t581492\t2\t581492\t2\t581495\t2\t581496\t2\t581496\t2\t581497\t2\t581497\t2\t581493\t2\t581493\t2\t581493\t2\t581499\t2\t581499\t2\t581499\t2\t581494\t2\t581498\t2\t581498\t2\t581500\t2\t581503\t2\t581507\t2\t581509\t2\t581510\t2\t581512\t2\t581517\t2\t581520\t2\t581522\t2\t581527\t2\t581528\t2\t581531\t2\t581565\t2\t581566\t2\t581570\t2\t581581\t2\t581581\t2\t581581\t2\t581581\t2\t581581\t2\t581581\t2\t581583\t2\t581584\t2\t581586\t2\t581596\t2\t581603\t2\t581608\t2\t581633\t2\t581659\t2\t581659\t2\t581659\t2\t581666\t2\t581666\t2\t58130\t2\t58138\t2\t581715\t2\t581754\t2\t58151\t2\t581790\t2\t581790\t2\t581795\t2\t58169\t2\t58171\t2\t58171\t2\t58175\t2\t58177\t2\t58177\t2\t58177\t2\t58178\t2\t58179\t2\t58179\t2\t58179\t2\t58180\t2\t58181\t2\t58182\t2\t58183\t2\t58184\t2\t581801\t2\t581805\t2\t581809\t2\t581810\t2\t581812\t2\t581813\t2\t581814\t2\t581817\t2\t581824\t2\t581825\t2\t581838\t2\t581853\t2\t581894\t2\t581154\t2\t581168\t2\t581168\t2\t581175\t2\t581176\t2\t581986\t2\t581212\t2\t581247\t2\t5811035\t2\t5811051\t2\t5811294\t2\t5811294\t2\t5811294\t2\t5811294\t2\t5811327\t2\t5811393\t2\t5811419\t2\t5811427\t2\t5811431\t2\t5811443\t2\t581315\t2\t581315\t2\t581317\t2\t581320\t2\t581382\t2\t581",

    "author": "Brookes, B. C.",
    "words": "Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the setsof periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively largeerrors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution areanalyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported andbecause they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work onobsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there stillremains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicalsthat contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period thanthose of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the conceptof \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%library..It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable;every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggestnew measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques thatare applicable to any other special case...X494\t2\t587494\t2\t587515\t2\t587519\t2\t587545\t2\t587552\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587587\t2\t587605\t2\t587613\t2\t587614\t2\t587638\t2\t587667\t2\t58733\t2\t58733\t2\t58736\t2\t58736\t2\t58741\t2\t587713\t2\t587735\t2\t587747\t2\t587748\t2\t587750\t2\t587750\t2\t587750\t2\t587750\t2\t587750\t2\t587751\t2\t587751\t2\t587753\t2\t587759\t2\t587764\t2\t587764\t2\t587765\t2\t587766\t2\t587767\t2\t587767\t2\t587767\t2\t58757\t2\t587775\t2\t587775\t2\t587775\t2\t587778\t2\t587778\t2\t587780\t2\t587782\t2\t587784\t2\t587787\t2\t587788\t2\t587789\t2\t587791\t2\t587792\t2\t587792\t2\t587792\t2\t587792\t2\t587793\t2\t587793\t2\t587793\t2\t587793\t2\t587793\t2\t587793\t2\t587793\t2\t587794\t2\t587794\t2\t587794\t2\t587794\t2\t587794\t2\t58773\t2\t58789\t2\t58797\t2\t587800\t2\t587800\t2\t587800\t2\t587800\t2\t587800\t2\t587800\t2\t587800\t2\t587804\t2\t587808\t2\t587808\t2\t587808\t2\t587823\t2\t587824\t2\t587829\t2\t587840\t2\t587895\t2\t587102\t2\t587106\t2\t587111\t2\t587112\t2\t587149\t2\t587155\t2\t587163\t2\t587175\t2\t587183\t2\t587184\t2\t587184\t2\t587193\t2\t587193\t2\t587195\t2\t587199\t2\t587905\t2\t587925\t2\t587948\t2\t587953\t2\t587977\t2\t587983\t2\t587201\t2\t587203\t2\t587203\t2\t587204\t2\t587205\t2\t587210\t2\t587222\t2\t587225\t2\t587225\t2\t587228\t2\t587229\t2\t587233\t2\t587267\t2\t587267\t2\t587269\t2\t5871016\t2\t5871023\t2\t5871030\t2\t5871055\t2\t5871081\t2\t5871083\t2\t5871085\t2\t5871085\t2\t5871086\t2\t5871086\t2\t5871087\t2\t5871082\t2\t5871090\t2\t5871091\t2\t5871123\t2\t5871135\t2\t5871201\t2\t5871219\t2\t5871222\t2\t5871260\t2\t5871275\t2\t5871276\t2\t5871278\t2\t5871278\t2\t5871280\t2\t5871282\t2\t5871285\t2\t5871285\t2\t5871285\t2\t5871285\t2\t5871286\t2\t5871287\t2\t5871287\t2\t5871302\t2\t5871308\t2\t5871307\t2\t5871324\t2\t5871335\t2\t5871390\t2\t5871397\t2\t5871401\t2\t5871416\t2\t5871417\t2\t5871417\t2\t5871417\t2\t5871418\t2\t5871428\t2\t5871432\t2\t587314\t2\t587359\t2\t587359\t2\t587373\t2\t587395\t2\t587",

The first group consists of 78 c-vspecialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title..These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialtyjournals being published by 28 national and international societies.. Thesecond group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees ofthe National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reportedto NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S.c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not themost quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14%of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of theliterature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-vjournals..The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing andabstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-rankingjournals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals...X429\t2\t588513\t2\t588543\t2\t588582\t2\t588588\t2\t588588\t2\t588588\t2\t588588\t2\t588588\t2\t588588\t2\t588589\t2\t588603\t2\t588613\t2\t588613\t2\t588613\t2\t588614\t2\t588616\t2\t588618\t2\t588624\t2\t588657\t2\t588685\t2\t588685\t2\t588686\t2\t588691\t2\t58833\t2\t58836\t2\t588721\t2\t588722\t2\t588724\t2\t588725\t2\t588735\t2\t588775\t2\t588793\t2\t588799\t2\t58890\t2\t58891\t2\t588800\t2\t588808\t2\t588821\t2\t588161\t2\t588183\t2\t588184\t2\t588193\t2\t588198\t2\t588199\t2\t588958\t2\t588959\t2\t588987\t2\t588988\t2\t588201\t2\t588202\t2\t588203\t2\t588204\t2\t588205\t2\t588209\t2\t588212\t2\t588217\t2\t588220\t2\t588222\t2\t588284\t2\t588286\t2\t588294\t2\t5881010\t2\t5881086\t2\t5881087\t2\t5881151\t2\t5881208\t2\t5881275\t2\t5881283\t2\t5881290\t2\t5881293\t2\t5881302\t2\t5881302\t2\t5881355\t2\t588379\t2\t588",

    "title": "Are Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative?",
    "author": "Tocatlian, Jacques J.",
    "words": "The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes andtheir numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titlesfor their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services,such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, butalso in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, suchas bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titlesof chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors becomeincreasingly aware of the importance of titles as \"carriers\" of information..The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papersare becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemicalpapers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948,1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive wordsin the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leadingsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of athesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leadingsubstantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use ofa thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count ofshort titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958,and 1968..Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers arebeing eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informativesince the advent of the KWIC index...X420\t2\t589429\t2\t589429\t2\t589503\t2\t589503\t2\t589510\t2\t589513\t2\t589517\t2\t589560\t2\t589576\t2\t589576\t2\t589578\t2\t589582\t2\t589582\t2\t589582\t2\t589582\t2\t589582\t2\t589584\t2\t589588\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589589\t2\t589594\t2\t589595\t2\t589603\t2\t589603\t2\t589603\t2\t589613\t2\t589614\t2\t589618\t2\t589655\t2\t589655\t2\t589656\t2\t589657\t2\t589657\t2\t589657\t2\t589657\t2\t589685\t2\t589686\t2\t589691\t2\t58935\t2\t58938\t2\t58938\t2\t58942\t2\t58943\t2\t589711\t2\t589721\t2\t589722\t2\t589722\t2\t589722\t2\t589722\t2\t589724\t2\t589725\t2\t58953\t2\t58952\t2\t58952\t2\t58952\t2\t58970\t2\t58976\t2\t58973\t2\t58981\t2\t58988\t2\t58989\t2\t58991\t2\t58995\t2\t58995\t2\t589820\t2\t589830\t2\t589104\t2\t589110\t2\t589150\t2\t589150\t2\t589150\t2\t589150\t2\t589161\t2\t589175\t2\t589175\t2\t589958\t2\t589987\t2\t589988\t2\t5891054\t2\t5891089\t2\t5891144\t2\t5891144\t2\t5891154\t2\t5891195\t2\t5891195\t2\t5891195\t2\t5891208\t2\t5891232\t2\t5891256\t2\t5891281\t2\t5891281\t2\t5891287\t2\t5891293\t2\t5891295\t2\t5891297\t2\t5891298\t2\t5891300\t2\t5891302\t2\t5891421\t2\t589384\t2\t589390\t2\t589",

After statingbasic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between atheory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval isconsidered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the generalcommunication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an orderincreasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoreticalindex is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems..

We suppose toothat Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to befull of scientific books, and that the best possibletechnical librarian would be somebody who had picked up alibrary qualification and combined it with the appropriatesort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used tosay, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemicalcompound.

    "words": "Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becomingincreasingly important, both for information retrieval and library supportoperations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost ofthe large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfacesare only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by theNational Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimentalretrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineeringthe right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful,concerted effort to engineer user acceptance..

    "words": "Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrievalpurposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematicexperiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestionshave been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatickeyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classificationsshould have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments weshowed that some forms of classification could give good results, and thispaper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort ofclassification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum formsof classification and procedures for using them in different retrievalsituations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements inperformance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and thatdefinite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classificationfor collections like the test one: the best results are given when groupingis confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when theclassification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexingterms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keywordfrequency...X445\t2\t596448\t2\t596454\t2\t596472\t2\t596480\t2\t596483\t2\t596484\t2\t596486\t2\t596487\t2\t596488\t2\t596488\t2\t596491\t2\t596493\t2\t596502\t2\t596503\t2\t596503\t2\t596506\t2\t596507\t2\t596507\t2\t596509\t2\t596509\t2\t596510\t2\t596512\t2\t596517\t2\t596520\t2\t596522\t2\t596527\t2\t596528\t2\t596531\t2\t596554\t2\t596565\t2\t596565\t2\t596566\t2\t596570\t2\t596572\t2\t596579\t2\t596579\t2\t596581\t2\t596591\t2\t596593\t2\t596594\t2\t596595\t2\t596595\t2\t596596\t2\t596596\t2\t596596\t2\t596596\t2\t596596\t2\t596596\t2\t596597\t2\t596599\t2\t596600\t2\t596600\t2\t596603\t2\t596603\t2\t596604\t2\t596606\t2\t596601\t2\t596608\t2\t596608\t2\t596619\t2\t596633\t2\t596659\t2\t596715\t2\t596723\t2\t596724\t2\t596754\t2\t59651\t2\t59657\t2\t596790\t2\t596799\t2\t59669\t2\t59663\t2\t59671\t2\t59675\t2\t59677\t2\t59679\t2\t596801\t2\t596805\t2\t596805\t2\t596805\t2\t596806\t2\t596807\t2\t596809\t2\t596810\t2\t596810\t2\t596812\t2\t596812\t2\t596813\t2\t596813\t2\t596814\t2\t596814\t2\t596817\t2\t596824\t2\t596825\t2\t596836\t2\t596863\t2\t596864\t2\t596866\t2\t596867\t2\t596870\t2\t596894\t2\t596894\t2\t596161\t2\t596168\t2\t596175\t2\t596175\t2\t596175\t2\t596176\t2\t596176\t2\t596176\t2\t596176\t2\t596197\t2\t596928\t2\t596956\t2\t596956\t2\t596963\t2\t596963\t2\t596987\t2\t596988\t2\t596989\t2\t596989\t2\t596990\t2\t596991\t2\t5961051\t2\t5961152\t2\t5961255\t2\t5961265\t2\t5961294\t2\t5961294\t2\t5961298\t2\t5961299\t2\t5961327\t2\t5961327\t2\t5961327\t2\t5961405\t2\t5961413\t2\t5961419\t2\t5961427\t2\t5961445\t2\t596315\t2\t596329\t2\t596348\t2\t596375\t2\t596382\t2\t596389\t2\t596390\t2\t596",

To fulfill thisresponsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicitreliable information concerning courses being offered relatingto information storage and retrieval, informationscience and/or documentation.  The data requestedincluded course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses,textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with whichoffered, etc.Responses were received from 45 schools, providinginformation about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Usingseveral methods of clustering the data, it was difficultto arrive at firm results, because of the diversity andscatter of the topics included in this field.  It wastherefore decided to hold a workshop of experts whichwould examine the validity of the questionnaire results.This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arriveat consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburghon September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in thefield representing universities industry and governmentwere brought together to participate.  Consensus wasreached in identifying nine factors which contribute tothe curriculum in information science and seven courseswhich constitute the core for the Master's program.The topics to be included in each of these courses werealso isolated..X5\t2\t598459\t2\t598505\t2\t598535\t2\t598548\t2\t598553\t2\t598594\t2\t598594\t2\t598597\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598598\t2\t598601\t2\t598779\t2\t598836\t2\t598863\t2\t598864\t2\t598865\t2\t598866\t2\t598868\t2\t598885\t2\t598897\t2\t598916\t2\t598936\t2\t598972\t2\t598217\t2\t598235\t2\t598243\t2\t598249\t2\t598289\t2\t598291\t2\t5981052\t2\t5981166\t2\t5981248\t2\t5981403\t2\t598364\t2\t598385\t2\t598",

Othercompound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases,while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy fromearlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture aterm, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have beenemployed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA)for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and haveenabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on theapplication of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinatebasis...X445\t2\t600454\t2\t600472\t2\t600477\t2\t600487\t2\t600502\t2\t600503\t2\t600506\t2\t600507\t2\t600554\t2\t600558\t2\t600558\t2\t600579\t2\t600579\t2\t600591\t2\t600593\t2\t600594\t2\t600595\t2\t600596\t2\t600596\t2\t600597\t2\t600599\t2\t600600\t2\t600600\t2\t600600\t2\t600600\t2\t600600\t2\t600603\t2\t600604\t2\t600606\t2\t600601\t2\t600653\t2\t600653\t2\t600723\t2\t600724\t2\t600746\t2\t600781\t2\t600799\t2\t60063\t2\t600801\t2\t600805\t2\t600805\t2\t600806\t2\t600807\t2\t600836\t2\t600863\t2\t600864\t2\t600866\t2\t600867\t2\t600160\t2\t600161\t2\t600175\t2\t600175\t2\t600197\t2\t600901\t2\t600956\t2\t600956\t2\t600963\t2\t600987\t2\t600988\t2\t600989\t2\t600989\t2\t6001152\t2\t6001265\t2\t6001294\t2\t6001298\t2\t6001299\t2\t6001327\t2\t6001327\t2\t6001394\t2\t6001405\t2\t6001414\t2\t6001422\t2\t600348\t2\t600375\t2\t600389\t2\t600390\t2\t600",

Consequently, theprocess of query formulation by the user, interactively with theinformation available in te system, remains one of the principalproblems in information retrieval today..In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interfacecommunication between man and the computer, we have pursued theobjective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRTin a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with alight pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Usinghis passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interactionvocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, ahierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may beaugmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance tothe user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems toreplicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely,thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's probleminto the structure and vocabulary of the system...X417\t2\t606445\t2\t606450\t2\t606451\t2\t606451\t2\t606452\t2\t606454\t2\t606458\t2\t606458\t2\t606459\t2\t606459\t2\t606460\t2\t606468\t2\t606472\t2\t606484\t2\t606484\t2\t606492\t2\t606503\t2\t606506\t2\t606507\t2\t606508\t2\t606508\t2\t606511\t2\t606512\t2\t606514\t2\t606514\t2\t606518\t2\t606520\t2\t606523\t2\t606523\t2\t606523\t2\t606524\t2\t606525\t2\t606526\t2\t606526\t2\t606526\t2\t606526\t2\t606528\t2\t606529\t2\t606530\t2\t606534\t2\t606534\t2\t606546\t2\t606546\t2\t606546\t2\t606546\t2\t606546\t2\t606546\t2\t606547\t2\t606553\t2\t606554\t2\t606579\t2\t606579\t2\t606579\t2\t606579\t2\t606584\t2\t606591\t2\t606591\t2\t606593\t2\t606593\t2\t606594\t2\t606594\t2\t606594\t2\t606594\t2\t606594\t2\t606594\t2\t606595\t2\t606596\t2\t606597\t2\t606599\t2\t606600\t2\t606603\t2\t606603\t2\t606604\t2\t606604\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606606\t2\t606609\t2\t606609\t2\t606610\t2\t606610\t2\t606611\t2\t606611\t2\t606612\t2\t606612\t2\t606612\t2\t606619\t2\t606625\t2\t606626\t2\t606626\t2\t606626\t2\t606626\t2\t606630\t2\t606636\t2\t606637\t2\t606637\t2\t606637\t2\t606641\t2\t606642\t2\t606642\t2\t606648\t2\t606650\t2\t606692\t2\t606696\t2\t606699\t2\t606703\t2\t606705\t2\t606708\t2\t606723\t2\t606724\t2\t606726\t2\t606727\t2\t606728\t2\t606731\t2\t606732\t2\t606733\t2\t606733\t2\t606734\t2\t606736\t2\t606738\t2\t606739\t2\t606740\t2\t606741\t2\t606742\t2\t606743\t2\t606744\t2\t606754\t2\t606755\t2\t60661\t2\t60666\t2\t60674\t2\t60675\t2\t606801\t2\t606805\t2\t606806\t2\t606814\t2\t606820\t2\t606826\t2\t606826\t2\t606826\t2\t606827\t2\t606830\t2\t606836\t2\t606866\t2\t606867\t2\t606879\t2\t606883\t2\t606124\t2\t606127\t2\t606129\t2\t606161\t2\t606190\t2\t606191\t2\t606197\t2\t606197\t2\t606197\t2\t606956\t2\t606989\t2\t606211\t2\t606214\t2\t606218\t2\t606218\t2\t606243\t2\t606274\t2\t6061004\t2\t6061035\t2\t6061035\t2\t6061035\t2\t6061078\t2\t6061089\t2\t6061091\t2\t6061207\t2\t6061264\t2\t6061297\t2\t6061298\t2\t6061299\t2\t6061303\t2\t6061303\t2\t6061327\t2\t6061356\t2\t6061364\t2\t6061368\t2\t6061370\t2\t6061372\t2\t6061373\t2\t6061374\t2\t6061374\t2\t6061375\t2\t6061376\t2\t6061377\t2\t6061377\t2\t6061387\t2\t6061405\t2\t6061427\t2\t606307\t2\t606320\t2\t606330\t2\t606332\t2\t606332\t2\t606343\t2\t606375\t2\t606378\t2\t606",

A replacementof the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked outputnormally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. Whenautomatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of theSMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtainedby the intellectual MEDLARS indexing..

    "words": "A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which canbe used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects orconcepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales onwhich a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in thedevelopment of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or moreindependent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identifythose clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-orientedreference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line referenceretrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factoranalyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I waslabeled \"evaluative-specific\" and accounted for over 23% of the totalvariance.. Factor II was called \"desirability\"; it accounted for over17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled \"enormity\" accountedfor over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factorstructure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived threedimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more generalclass of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured systemevaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjectivescales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structureand the need for a predicative replication of the study...X417\t2\t610448\t2\t610450\t2\t610451\t2\t610452\t2\t610452\t2\t610459\t2\t610468\t2\t610484\t2\t610484\t2\t610492\t2\t610508\t2\t610511\t2\t610511\t2\t610512\t2\t610514\t2\t610514\t2\t610516\t2\t610518\t2\t610518\t2\t610520\t2\t610521\t2\t610522\t2\t610523\t2\t610523\t2\t610524\t2\t610525\t2\t610526\t2\t610526\t2\t610527\t2\t610528\t2\t610529\t2\t610529\t2\t610530\t2\t610534\t2\t610546\t2\t610546\t2\t610553\t2\t610575\t2\t610579\t2\t610586\t2\t610591\t2\t610594\t2\t610597\t2\t610603\t2\t610603\t2\t610604\t2\t610606\t2\t610606\t2\t610608\t2\t610608\t2\t610609\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610610\t2\t610611\t2\t610611\t2\t610612\t2\t610612\t2\t610612\t2\t610615\t2\t610617\t2\t610620\t2\t610625\t2\t610625\t2\t610626\t2\t610626\t2\t610626\t2\t610630\t2\t610636\t2\t610636\t2\t610637\t2\t610642\t2\t610648\t2\t610650\t2\t610692\t2\t610696\t2\t610699\t2\t610700\t2\t610703\t2\t610705\t2\t610705\t2\t610707\t2\t610708\t2\t610726\t2\t610727\t2\t610727\t2\t610728\t2\t610731\t2\t610732\t2\t610733\t2\t610734\t2\t610736\t2\t610738\t2\t610739\t2\t610740\t2\t610741\t2\t610742\t2\t610743\t2\t610744\t2\t610754\t2\t610755\t2\t61090\t2\t610812\t2\t610815\t2\t610817\t2\t610820\t2\t610824\t2\t610826\t2\t610827\t2\t610875\t2\t610879\t2\t610883\t2\t610124\t2\t610124\t2\t610124\t2\t610125\t2\t610127\t2\t610129\t2\t610165\t2\t610190\t2\t610191\t2\t610197\t2\t610938\t2\t610939\t2\t610986\t2\t610991\t2\t610992\t2\t610211\t2\t610214\t2\t610218\t2\t610231\t2\t610243\t2\t610261\t2\t610295\t2\t610299\t2\t6101004\t2\t6101035\t2\t6101047\t2\t6101078\t2\t6101089\t2\t6101091\t2\t6101207\t2\t6101221\t2\t6101264\t2\t6101297\t2\t6101303\t2\t6101303\t2\t6101303\t2\t6101318\t2\t6101327\t2\t6101356\t2\t6101364\t2\t6101364\t2\t6101365\t2\t6101366\t2\t6101367\t2\t6101368\t2\t6101368\t2\t6101370\t2\t6101372\t2\t6101373\t2\t6101374\t2\t6101375\t2\t6101376\t2\t6101377\t2\t6101387\t2\t6101390\t2\t610307\t2\t610330\t2\t610334\t2\t610343\t2\t610354\t2\t610378\t2\t610381\t2\t610",

    "words": "In an attempt to further amplify the characteristics of the cardiovascularserial literature, citation patterns were studied.. As previously shown,one-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstractjournals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300cardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used togather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during thisfour-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate byyear serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak duringthe third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citationwere noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author,15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basicjournals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of thecitations were found in these journals.. Although the citations werefound throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, arelatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals...X429\t2\t613513\t2\t613543\t2\t613545\t2\t613552\t2\t613582\t2\t613587\t2\t613588\t2\t613588\t2\t613588\t2\t613589\t2\t613603\t2\t613605\t2\t613605\t2\t613613\t2\t613613\t2\t613613\t2\t613613\t2\t613613\t2\t613613\t2\t613614\t2\t613614\t2\t613618\t2\t613624\t2\t613638\t2\t613657\t2\t613685\t2\t613686\t2\t613691\t2\t61333\t2\t61333\t2\t61336\t2\t61336\t2\t61341\t2\t613721\t2\t613722\t2\t613724\t2\t613725\t2\t613735\t2\t613747\t2\t613750\t2\t613753\t2\t613766\t2\t613767\t2\t613770\t2\t613775\t2\t613776\t2\t613782\t2\t613784\t2\t613788\t2\t613789\t2\t613793\t2\t613799\t2\t61389\t2\t61390\t2\t61391\t2\t61397\t2\t613800\t2\t613800\t2\t613808\t2\t613808\t2\t613102\t2\t613111\t2\t613112\t2\t613161\t2\t613163\t2\t613183\t2\t613183\t2\t613184\t2\t613184\t2\t613193\t2\t613193\t2\t613199\t2\t613199\t2\t613905\t2\t613953\t2\t613958\t2\t613959\t2\t613977\t2\t613983\t2\t613987\t2\t613988\t2\t613201\t2\t613202\t2\t613203\t2\t613203\t2\t613204\t2\t613205\t2\t613209\t2\t613210\t2\t613212\t2\t613217\t2\t613220\t2\t613222\t2\t613225\t2\t613269\t2\t613284\t2\t613286\t2\t613294\t2\t6131016\t2\t6131023\t2\t6131030\t2\t6131055\t2\t6131087\t2\t6131087\t2\t6131090\t2\t6131135\t2\t6131151\t2\t6131208\t2\t6131260\t2\t6131275\t2\t6131276\t2\t6131278\t2\t6131280\t2\t6131285\t2\t6131286\t2\t6131287\t2\t6131293\t2\t6131302\t2\t6131302\t2\t6131302\t2\t6131335\t2\t6131390\t2\t6131397\t2\t6131417\t2\t6131428\t2\t6131432\t2\t613373\t2\t613377\t2\t613",

    "title": "A Cost Model for Evaluating Information Retrieval Systems",
    "author": "Cooper, Michael D.",
    "words": "This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how tominimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Throughthe use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparativeevaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides thecosts of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performancelevel of the system and the combination of user and systems time that isexpended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost ofoperating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance leveland for a given cost per unit of user and system time...X5\t2\t615417\t2\t615435\t2\t615446\t2\t615448\t2\t615452\t2\t615456\t2\t615458\t2\t615458\t2\t615468\t2\t615484\t2\t615485\t2\t615511\t2\t615514\t2\t615514\t2\t615516\t2\t615518\t2\t615518\t2\t615521\t2\t615522\t2\t615523\t2\t615526\t2\t615527\t2\t615528\t2\t615529\t2\t615554\t2\t615572\t2\t615575\t2\t615575\t2\t615577\t2\t615579\t2\t615579\t2\t615591\t2\t615595\t2\t615595\t2\t615599\t2\t615603\t2\t615610\t2\t615615\t2\t615615\t2\t615615\t2\t615615\t2\t615615\t2\t615619\t2\t615620\t2\t615621\t2\t615625\t2\t615625\t2\t615626\t2\t615630\t2\t615636\t2\t615640\t2\t615646\t2\t61528\t2\t615700\t2\t615705\t2\t615707\t2\t615727\t2\t615752\t2\t615752\t2\t615754\t2\t615780\t2\t615785\t2\t61590\t2\t61591\t2\t615812\t2\t615815\t2\t615817\t2\t615820\t2\t615822\t2\t615822\t2\t615824\t2\t615827\t2\t615829\t2\t615875\t2\t615895\t2\t615124\t2\t615125\t2\t615157\t2\t615158\t2\t615165\t2\t615172\t2\t615175\t2\t615191\t2\t615194\t2\t615902\t2\t615907\t2\t615957\t2\t615212\t2\t615222\t2\t615223\t2\t615224\t2\t615274\t2\t615298\t2\t6151023\t2\t6151033\t2\t6151084\t2\t6151091\t2\t6151219\t2\t6151227\t2\t6151279\t2\t6151282\t2\t6151303\t2\t6151327\t2\t6151364\t2\t6151365\t2\t6151366\t2\t6151367\t2\t6151368\t2\t6151387\t2\t6151390\t2\t615368\t2\t615381\t2\t615381\t2\t615381\t2\t615389\t2\t615",

Epistemology is used as aprescriptive modeling basis because (1) the fundamental problems ofepistemology are concerned with information, and (2), because the history ofepistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived ofinformation and of models..It is shown how the different models of epistemology can be madescientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systemsanalysis..Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the modelsare presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of futureexperiments...X445\t2\t621456\t2\t621458\t2\t621459\t2\t621476\t2\t621514\t2\t621525\t2\t621525\t2\t621530\t2\t621554\t2\t621575\t2\t621575\t2\t621579\t2\t621590\t2\t621591\t2\t621595\t2\t621599\t2\t621599\t2\t621603\t2\t621615\t2\t621619\t2\t621620\t2\t621621\t2\t621621\t2\t621621\t2\t621621\t2\t621621\t2\t621621\t2\t621625\t2\t621630\t2\t621630\t2\t621641\t2\t621641\t2\t621668\t2\t621670\t2\t621671\t2\t621674\t2\t621683\t2\t621689\t2\t621692\t2\t621715\t2\t621752\t2\t621780\t2\t621797\t2\t621819\t2\t621822\t2\t621898\t2\t621117\t2\t621120\t2\t621128\t2\t621135\t2\t621165\t2\t621165\t2\t621165\t2\t621175\t2\t621907\t2\t621925\t2\t621224\t2\t621244\t2\t621245\t2\t621291\t2\t621298\t2\t6211077\t2\t6211077\t2\t6211231\t2\t6211231\t2\t6211231\t2\t6211402\t2\t621350\t2\t621381\t2\t621",

For this reason, thereare few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently,most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage andretrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order toinvestigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted..The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authorsand readers is linear in nature (\"one-way\" communication allowing noreciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updatedby both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauriviewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cyberneticprocess of communication (\"both-way\" communication).. The surveyindicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largelydone by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory ofthesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued thatsuch a theory, if developed, should at least account for the conceptsof meaning and knowledge..

    "words": "It has been suggested that information science is still of the stageof alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form itsphilosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to theobservable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series ofexamples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beachesand man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena likecontinental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is alsoconsidered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mentalpowers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusiveseries of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusivethinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, andthis results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, itis observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard toexisting classifications and is more likely to be involved in anintegrated approach to problems...X449\t2\t628522\t2\t628530\t2\t628530\t2\t628553\t2\t628558\t2\t628558\t2\t628572\t2\t628627\t2\t628627\t2\t628628\t2\t628628\t2\t628628\t2\t628628\t2\t628628\t2\t628795\t2\t62872\t2\t628802\t2\t628819\t2\t628873\t2\t628874\t2\t628874\t2\t628874\t2\t628875\t2\t628875\t2\t628876\t2\t628877\t2\t628878\t2\t628892\t2\t628892\t2\t628141\t2\t628160\t2\t628940\t2\t628941\t2\t628941\t2\t628941\t2\t628992\t2\t628994\t2\t628993\t2\t628995\t2\t628995\t2\t628995\t2\t628997\t2\t628996\t2\t628998\t2\t628299\t2\t628299\t2\t6281046\t2\t6281079\t2\t6281079\t2\t6281079\t2\t6281153\t2\t6281189\t2\t6281202\t2\t6281216\t2\t6281218\t2\t6281251\t2\t6281351\t2\t6281351\t2\t6281396\t2\t6281399\t2\t6281420\t2\t6281420\t2\t6281421\t2\t6281434\t2\t6281434\t2\t6281434\t2\t6281435\t2\t6281435\t2\t6281435\t2\t6281436\t2\t6281442\t2\t6281442\t2\t628333\t2\t628333\t2\t628333\t2\t628",

    "words": "The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of informationstorage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer isrecognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effectivealternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalentphilosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designerstouted the computer as the answer to all information storage andretrieval situations.. Important principles of information systemdesign incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophyfor the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users'needs studies by the representative small group technique; theanalysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority;the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitableexistent information storage and retrieval system from those available;the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishinga model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the finaldesign of a cost-effective system..

    "title": "Text Searching Retrieval of Answer-Sentences and Other Answer-Passages",
    "author": "O'Connor, John",
    "words": "Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrievenot documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasionsdetermined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of thetechniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, \"answer-passages\" areretrieved.. An \"answer-passage\" is a passage which is either answer-providingor \"answer-indicative,\" i.e., it permits inferring that the documentcontaining it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e.,single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantagesfor screening retrieval output..Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relationbetween clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximatessyntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening \"syntacticjoints\" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuationmarks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses wordproximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..The computer uses \"enclosure\" and \"connector words\" for determiningwhen a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedurewas found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages,which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve twoanswer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because ofone multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failureof clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents theyretrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART,which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used inthis study were from the field of information science.. The results of thestudy are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a \"soft science,\" andit is reasonable to hope that in less \"soft\" sciences and technologiesthe techniques described will work even better.. On this basis adissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted...X448\t2\t636450\t2\t636451\t2\t636452\t2\t636452\t2\t636459\t2\t636459\t2\t636468\t2\t636484\t2\t636484\t2\t636492\t2\t636508\t2\t636511\t2\t636511\t2\t636512\t2\t636514\t2\t636514\t2\t636514\t2\t636516\t2\t636518\t2\t636518\t2\t636520\t2\t636520\t2\t636521\t2\t636522\t2\t636523\t2\t636523\t2\t636524\t2\t636524\t2\t636525\t2\t636525\t2\t636526\t2\t636526\t2\t636527\t2\t636527\t2\t636528\t2\t636529\t2\t636529\t2\t636529\t2\t636530\t2\t636530\t2\t636534\t2\t636534\t2\t636546\t2\t636553\t2\t636570\t2\t636575\t2\t636576\t2\t636579\t2\t636586\t2\t636594\t2\t636603\t2\t636604\t2\t636606\t2\t636608\t2\t636609\t2\t636609\t2\t636610\t2\t636610\t2\t636611\t2\t636612\t2\t636615\t2\t636625\t2\t636625\t2\t636626\t2\t636626\t2\t636630\t2\t636633\t2\t636635\t2\t636636\t2\t636636\t2\t636636\t2\t636636\t2\t636636\t2\t636636\t2\t636637\t2\t636637\t2\t636642\t2\t636642\t2\t636643\t2\t636648\t2\t636650\t2\t636659\t2\t636692\t2\t636696\t2\t636699\t2\t63618\t2\t636700\t2\t636702\t2\t636703\t2\t636703\t2\t636705\t2\t636705\t2\t636707\t2\t636708\t2\t636726\t2\t636726\t2\t636727\t2\t636727\t2\t636728\t2\t636730\t2\t636731\t2\t636732\t2\t636732\t2\t636733\t2\t636733\t2\t636734\t2\t636734\t2\t636736\t2\t636736\t2\t636738\t2\t636739\t2\t636740\t2\t636741\t2\t636742\t2\t636743\t2\t636744\t2\t636754\t2\t636755\t2\t63675\t2\t63686\t2\t636812\t2\t636817\t2\t636820\t2\t636820\t2\t636824\t2\t636826\t2\t636826\t2\t636827\t2\t636827\t2\t636875\t2\t636877\t2\t636879\t2\t636879\t2\t636883\t2\t636894\t2\t636124\t2\t636124\t2\t636125\t2\t636127\t2\t636127\t2\t636129\t2\t636145\t2\t636165\t2\t636175\t2\t636190\t2\t636191\t2\t636197\t2\t636211\t2\t636214\t2\t636218\t2\t636243\t2\t6361004\t2\t6361035\t2\t6361078\t2\t6361089\t2\t6361091\t2\t6361207\t2\t6361264\t2\t6361294\t2\t6361297\t2\t6361303\t2\t6361303\t2\t6361313\t2\t6361327\t2\t6361327\t2\t6361356\t2\t6361364\t2\t6361364\t2\t6361366\t2\t6361367\t2\t6361368\t2\t6361368\t2\t6361370\t2\t6361370\t2\t6361372\t2\t6361372\t2\t6361373\t2\t6361374\t2\t6361375\t2\t6361376\t2\t6361377\t2\t6361383\t2\t6361396\t2\t6361419\t2\t636307\t2\t636330\t2\t636357\t2\t636376\t2\t636378\t2\t636381\t2\t636382\t2\t636389\t2\t636390\t2\t636",

    "words": "Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which theyhave had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author-title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be ableto look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they mayremember a surprising amount of such \"nonstandard\" information as thecolor of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could thistype of \"nonstandard\" information be profitably exploited in computerizedcatalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely beused, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today'slibrary patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantialminority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results ofa memory experiment to test the memorability of various types ofnonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking accordingto relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of variousnonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the averagepatron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrievalstrategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredthas many documents as in a random search..

The notion of relevance is takenas the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparativeconcept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability..The resulting technique called \"Probabilistic Indexing,\" allows a computingmachine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inferenceand derive a number (called the \"relevance number\") for each document, whichis a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given requestranked according to their probable relevance..The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional librarysystem the cross-referencing (\"see\" and \"see also\") is based solely onthe \"semantical closeness\" between index terms, statistical measures ofcloseness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, givenan arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machinecan elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevantdocuments that would not otherwise have been selected..Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole libraryproblem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis ofwhich the library system makes a concatenated statistical inferencein order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documentswhich most probably satisfy the information needs of the user...X419\t2\t660419\t2\t660419\t2\t660419\t2\t660419\t2\t660422\t2\t660422\t2\t660441\t2\t660441\t2\t660441\t2\t660444\t2\t660445\t2\t660445\t2\t660445\t2\t660447\t2\t660448\t2\t660449\t2\t660449\t2\t660457\t2\t660458\t2\t660458\t2\t660462\t2\t660471\t2\t660474\t2\t660479\t2\t660485\t2\t660486\t2\t660509\t2\t660518\t2\t660519\t2\t660531\t2\t660532\t2\t660562\t2\t660562\t2\t660562\t2\t660564\t2\t660564\t2\t660565\t2\t660565\t2\t660565\t2\t660566\t2\t660566\t2\t660570\t2\t660575\t2\t660575\t2\t660577\t2\t660577\t2\t660577\t2\t660577\t2\t660577\t2\t660625\t2\t660625\t2\t660625\t2\t660634\t2\t660643\t2\t660644\t2\t660644\t2\t660644\t2\t660649\t2\t660649\t2\t660652\t2\t660652\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660660\t2\t660661\t2\t660661\t2\t660662\t2\t660662\t2\t660662\t2\t660662\t2\t660662\t2\t660663\t2\t660664\t2\t660664\t2\t66026\t2\t66026\t2\t66026\t2\t66029\t2\t66035\t2\t66042\t2\t66043\t2\t66043\t2\t660714\t2\t660752\t2\t660752\t2\t660754\t2\t660762\t2\t660762\t2\t660764\t2\t66051\t2\t66051\t2\t66051\t2\t660769\t2\t66058\t2\t66057\t2\t66054\t2\t66054\t2\t660780\t2\t660780\t2\t660780\t2\t660785\t2\t660785\t2\t660785\t2\t66061\t2\t66069\t2\t66070\t2\t66075\t2\t66075\t2\t66079\t2\t66079\t2\t66073\t2\t66073\t2\t66084\t2\t660806\t2\t660810\t2\t660810\t2\t660810\t2\t660812\t2\t660812\t2\t660812\t2\t660824\t2\t660824\t2\t660829\t2\t660830\t2\t660893\t2\t660895\t2\t660114\t2\t660144\t2\t660150\t2\t660150\t2\t660174\t2\t660175\t2\t660175\t2\t660175\t2\t660176\t2\t660176\t2\t660956\t2\t660960\t2\t660274\t2\t6601016\t2\t6601030\t2\t6601044\t2\t6601045\t2\t6601084\t2\t6601144\t2\t6601154\t2\t6601195\t2\t6601201\t2\t6601202\t2\t6601202\t2\t6601218\t2\t6601218\t2\t6601219\t2\t6601235\t2\t6601281\t2\t6601282\t2\t6601282\t2\t6601282\t2\t6601285\t2\t6601294\t2\t6601294\t2\t6601307\t2\t6601327\t2\t6601327\t2\t6601382\t2\t6601427\t2\t660309\t2\t660315\t2\t660319\t2\t660319\t2\t660321\t2\t660328\t2\t660328\t2\t660389\t2\t660390\t2\t660390\t2\t660",

But automatic classification study also has beenthriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treatedat considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support thehypothesis that classification quality improves as more information abouteach document is used for input to the classification program.. Sixnonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computerruns in which the number of words per document is increased progressivelyfrom 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, andtwo point to no effect..

Many people do like to use their minds, yes -but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material..Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in informationretrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has ledprimarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centeredaround the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditionshave been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and whoknows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as idealcorrespondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attentionhas been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries..

While previous work has focused on one component of sentencesignificance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words),the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmaticwords (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentencelocation).The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology.The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence ofthe above four components.  The research methodology includes procedures forthe compilation of the required dictionaries, the setting of the controlparameters, and the comparative evaluation of the automatic extracts withmanually produced extracts.  The results indicate that the three newly proposedcomponents dominate the frequency component in the production of betterextracts.KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  automatic extracting, automatic abstracting, sentenceselection, document screening, sentence significance, relevance, content words,key words, pragmatic words, cue words, title words, sentence location, researchmethodology, parameterization, comparative evaluation..X420\t2\t666420\t2\t666420\t2\t666420\t2\t666458\t2\t666499\t2\t666499\t2\t666499\t2\t666503\t2\t666516\t2\t666527\t2\t666571\t2\t666571\t2\t666572\t2\t666581\t2\t666581\t2\t666657\t2\t666662\t2\t666664\t2\t666666\t2\t666666\t2\t666666\t2\t666666\t2\t666666\t2\t666666\t2\t66626\t2\t66630\t2\t66635\t2\t66639\t2\t66671\t2\t66675\t2\t66677\t2\t66678\t2\t66679\t2\t66680\t2\t66681\t2\t66682\t2\t66683\t2\t666838\t2\t666853\t2\t666114\t2\t666154\t2\t666175\t2\t666175\t2\t666212\t2\t666247\t2\t6661393\t2\t6661428\t2\t6661431\t2\t666315\t2\t666315\t2\t666324\t2\t666",

He wants the index to help him togenerate thoughts and to suggest new combinations.He wants the index to help him in terms of his language,logic, and semantics and through a generic or specificapproach, whichever occurs to him first.

TheWLN generation programs accept connection table input, either from a previouslyexisting file or generated from the Rand Tablet drawing.  The programs recognizesituations which they cannot handle - the output is thus either correct WLNor a message by which the programs acknowledge their limitations.  In general,correct WLN will be produced for any compound containing not more than onenonbenzene ring.  Work is under way to extend this to polycyclic fused ringsystems.

While remaining generally within the framework of IUPACand other existing nomenclature rules, the most systematic recommended nameshave been chosen.  These names are more easily derived from molecular structuraldiagrams, and, therefore, are more quickly found by index users.  Machineediting of index names and translation of these names into structuralrepresentations in the CAS computer-based information system are also aidedby the revisions.  The index name revisions include (i) conversion of almost all\"trivial\" or author terminology into more systematic names, (ii) simplificationof general name-selection rules, and (iii) elimination of special treatment forcertain classes of substances.  Specific identifiable alloys, elementaryparticles, enzymes, and mixtures of substances are now indexed like conventionalchemical substances.  Difficulties encountered with generation of previousChemical Abstracts index names and indexing rules are described, and comparisonsare made of new and former index names for chemical compounds and substituentradicals..X677\t2\t701677\t2\t701701\t2\t701701\t2\t701701\t2\t701701\t2\t701701\t2\t701709\t2\t701738\t2\t701",

    "words": "There are many chemical retrieval systems whichprocess the first type of request efficiently.  Most of thesesystems are also capable of handling certain fragmentrequests; however, the fragments which can be processedare frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, inretrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, onlythose fragments which are explicit in the cipher arereadily detected.  To allow a completely generalspecification of fragments it seems inevitable that adetailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the queryand library structures.  A technique for making such detailedcomparisons is presented in this report.  This techniqueis novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking adrestarting required by other atom-by-atom matchingprocedures.Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,some definitions are reviewed and a brief example ispresented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flowdiagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additionalexamples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm fora digital computer is discussed.This report is a condensed version of the original, whichgives a generalization and comprehensive description ofthe algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,and applications other than chemical retrieval systems..X568\t2\t706568\t2\t706569\t2\t706641\t2\t706668\t2\t706669\t2\t706670\t2\t706671\t2\t706671\t2\t706673\t2\t706677\t2\t706677\t2\t706678\t2\t706678\t2\t706679\t2\t706682\t2\t706689\t2\t706690\t2\t706693\t2\t706694\t2\t706695\t2\t706698\t2\t706700\t2\t706704\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706706\t2\t706707\t2\t706730\t2\t706738\t2\t706833\t2\t706890\t2\t706890\t2\t706890\t2\t706116\t2\t706117\t2\t706253\t2\t706254\t2\t7061026\t2\t7061026\t2\t7061072\t2\t7061092\t2\t7061202\t2\t7061292\t2\t7061292\t2\t7061301\t2\t7061444\t2\t7061452\t2\t7061452\t2\t706327\t2\t706327\t2\t706327\t2\t706",

Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-aloneinput, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organicchemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increasedto include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has beenintegrated into CAS indexing operations.  The third refinement of this system,Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves majorchanges in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniquesfor registering chemical substances.  The previous format for listing atomsand bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separatelyidentified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for eachsubstance that contains that ring.  These modifications support CAS nomenclaturederivation and also a computer-based structure output system.  The generaldesign of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclicsegments, is presented..X422\t2\t709577\t2\t709641\t2\t709643\t2\t709644\t2\t709645\t2\t709649\t2\t709650\t2\t709670\t2\t709671\t2\t709671\t2\t709674\t2\t709674\t2\t709674\t2\t709675\t2\t709700\t2\t709701\t2\t709708\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709709\t2\t709731\t2\t709738\t2\t709738\t2\t709755\t2\t709825\t2\t709830\t2\t7091261\t2\t7091292\t2\t709",

Titles in chemistryare more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alertingand other services based on titles requires a good understanding of theunderlying information transfer principles..X421\t2\t722429\t2\t722429\t2\t722429\t2\t722465\t2\t722466\t2\t722490\t2\t722491\t2\t722506\t2\t722507\t2\t722510\t2\t722510\t2\t722512\t2\t722513\t2\t722513\t2\t722560\t2\t722582\t2\t722582\t2\t722582\t2\t722588\t2\t722589\t2\t722589\t2\t722589\t2\t722589\t2\t722591\t2\t722595\t2\t722603\t2\t722603\t2\t722603\t2\t722603\t2\t722604\t2\t722613\t2\t722614\t2\t722618\t2\t722622\t2\t722623\t2\t722629\t2\t722633\t2\t722639\t2\t722657\t2\t722659\t2\t722676\t2\t722685\t2\t722686\t2\t722691\t2\t72218\t2\t72234\t2\t72238\t2\t72238\t2\t72249\t2\t722711\t2\t722721\t2\t722722\t2\t722722\t2\t722722\t2\t722722\t2\t722722\t2\t722722\t2\t722722\t2\t722723\t2\t722724\t2\t722725\t2\t722726\t2\t722728\t2\t722730\t2\t722731\t2\t722732\t2\t72253\t2\t72252\t2\t72252\t2\t72259\t2\t722770\t2\t722776\t2\t72288\t2\t72289\t2\t72291\t2\t722809\t2\t722810\t2\t722813\t2\t722814\t2\t722820\t2\t722822\t2\t722828\t2\t722830\t2\t722870\t2\t722879\t2\t722150\t2\t722150\t2\t722164\t2\t722958\t2\t722987\t2\t722988\t2\t722202\t2\t722213\t2\t722224\t2\t722243\t2\t7221030\t2\t7221091\t2\t7221144\t2\t7221195\t2\t7221195\t2\t7221208\t2\t7221256\t2\t7221283\t2\t7221293\t2\t7221298\t2\t7221299\t2\t7221302\t2\t7221363\t2\t7221366\t2\t7221367\t2\t7221368\t2\t7221396\t2\t7221421\t2\t722384\t2\t722",

    "words": "The academic users of the bibliographic information dissemination centerwere surveyed to determine the ways in which the search results were beingused, the impact which the services had had on professional activities suchas research and instruction, the interface between the computer-basedretrieval and the traditional form of library resources, and the effect ofdocument overlap between different data bases.  The survey results indicatethat the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of thefaculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia,with an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each searchquestion.

The users indicated several changes in library use habits as aresult of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to theprimary literature and increased use of library resources as they had beenmade aware of new sources and media - e.g., microforms.

    "author": "Leggate, P.Rossiter, B.N.Rowland, J.F.B.",
    "words": "The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is themachine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts inChemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlierpaper, we described the development of an experimentalselective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) servicebased on these tapes.  A detailed description of thetechniques of profile construction for searching aWiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given inthis earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluationof the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measuresof retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also ofuser reactions to the service, as expressed in their repliesto a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used toidentify the reasons for retrieval failures and possiblemethods for improving retrieval performance.  A fullerdescription of the evaluation has been published in reportform..X421\t2\t731433\t2\t731440\t2\t731450\t2\t731451\t2\t731452\t2\t731452\t2\t731453\t2\t731459\t2\t731459\t2\t731465\t2\t731466\t2\t731467\t2\t731468\t2\t731468\t2\t731484\t2\t731490\t2\t731491\t2\t731492\t2\t731495\t2\t731506\t2\t731506\t2\t731507\t2\t731508\t2\t731508\t2\t731510\t2\t731511\t2\t731511\t2\t731512\t2\t731512\t2\t731512\t2\t731514\t2\t731514\t2\t731517\t2\t731518\t2\t731520\t2\t731520\t2\t731521\t2\t731523\t2\t731523\t2\t731524\t2\t731524\t2\t731525\t2\t731526\t2\t731526\t2\t731528\t2\t731529\t2\t731530\t2\t731534\t2\t731534\t2\t731546\t2\t731553\t2\t731576\t2\t731579\t2\t731580\t2\t731591\t2\t731594\t2\t731595\t2\t731603\t2\t731603\t2\t731604\t2\t731604\t2\t731604\t2\t731606\t2\t731609\t2\t731609\t2\t731610\t2\t731611\t2\t731612\t2\t731612\t2\t731619\t2\t731622\t2\t731622\t2\t731623\t2\t731623\t2\t731625\t2\t731626\t2\t731629\t2\t731629\t2\t731630\t2\t731631\t2\t731632\t2\t731633\t2\t731633\t2\t731636\t2\t731637\t2\t731639\t2\t731642\t2\t731648\t2\t731650\t2\t731659\t2\t731676\t2\t731692\t2\t731696\t2\t731699\t2\t731699\t2\t73110\t2\t73118\t2\t73118\t2\t73134\t2\t73149\t2\t731700\t2\t731700\t2\t731702\t2\t731703\t2\t731705\t2\t731705\t2\t731707\t2\t731708\t2\t731709\t2\t731711\t2\t731722\t2\t731723\t2\t731723\t2\t731726\t2\t731726\t2\t731726\t2\t731727\t2\t731727\t2\t731728\t2\t731728\t2\t731728\t2\t731729\t2\t731730\t2\t731730\t2\t731731\t2\t731731\t2\t731731\t2\t731731\t2\t731731\t2\t731732\t2\t731732\t2\t731732\t2\t731733\t2\t731734\t2\t731736\t2\t731738\t2\t731738\t2\t731739\t2\t731740\t2\t731741\t2\t731742\t2\t731743\t2\t731744\t2\t731754\t2\t731755\t2\t73153\t2\t73159\t2\t731809\t2\t731810\t2\t731812\t2\t731813\t2\t731813\t2\t731814\t2\t731814\t2\t731817\t2\t731820\t2\t731820\t2\t731820\t2\t731820\t2\t731822\t2\t731822\t2\t731823\t2\t731825\t2\t731826\t2\t731826\t2\t731827\t2\t731827\t2\t731828\t2\t731828\t2\t731866\t2\t731870\t2\t731870\t2\t731873\t2\t731879\t2\t731879\t2\t731883\t2\t731124\t2\t731125\t2\t731127\t2\t731129\t2\t731145\t2\t731164\t2\t731190\t2\t731190\t2\t731191\t2\t731197\t2\t731947\t2\t731948\t2\t731202\t2\t731211\t2\t731211\t2\t731213\t2\t731214\t2\t731218\t2\t731224\t2\t731225\t2\t731243\t2\t731243\t2\t731244\t2\t7311004\t2\t7311017\t2\t7311035\t2\t7311058\t2\t7311078\t2\t7311078\t2\t7311089\t2\t7311089\t2\t7311091\t2\t7311091\t2\t7311091\t2\t7311143\t2\t7311146\t2\t7311207\t2\t7311230\t2\t7311257\t2\t7311264\t2\t7311264\t2\t7311283\t2\t7311297\t2\t7311298\t2\t7311299\t2\t7311302\t2\t7311303\t2\t7311303\t2\t7311356\t2\t7311363\t2\t7311364\t2\t7311366\t2\t7311366\t2\t7311367\t2\t7311367\t2\t7311368\t2\t7311368\t2\t7311368\t2\t7311370\t2\t7311372\t2\t7311373\t2\t7311374\t2\t7311375\t2\t7311376\t2\t7311377\t2\t7311390\t2\t7311396\t2\t7311396\t2\t731304\t2\t731305\t2\t731306\t2\t731307\t2\t731330\t2\t731358\t2\t731378\t2\t731378\t2\t731385\t2\t731394\t2\t731",

For purposes ofcomparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard isrepresented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2.  Theresults of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4.The reader can draw several obvious conclusions.  Abouthalf of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to paperspublished in the 1950's.  This, in part, reflects thepresent highly vigorous state of chemical investigationand its rapid expansion in recent years.  Another strikingfact is that in the Journal of the American ChemicalSociety, 39.5% of the citations are to previous workpublished in the journal itself.  In Industrial andEngineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citationsis 21.3.  To some extent this may result from the factthat writers who habitually publish in a particularjournal tend to cite their own work.  However, it seemsto reflect to a greater degree the dominance of thesejournals in their respective fields.  More than 38%of the citations in Industrial and Engineering Chemistryare to various American Chemical Society publications.In the Journal of the American Chemical Society more than45% of the citations are to Society publications..X473\t2\t735543\t2\t735545\t2\t735552\t2\t735552\t2\t735587\t2\t735588\t2\t735592\t2\t735605\t2\t735613\t2\t735614\t2\t735614\t2\t735616\t2\t735638\t2\t735638\t2\t735685\t2\t73533\t2\t73536\t2\t73537\t2\t73541\t2\t735716\t2\t735735\t2\t735735\t2\t735735\t2\t735735\t2\t735735\t2\t735735\t2\t735735\t2\t735747\t2\t735750\t2\t735753\t2\t735766\t2\t735766\t2\t735767\t2\t735775\t2\t735775\t2\t735782\t2\t735784\t2\t735784\t2\t735784\t2\t735788\t2\t735789\t2\t735793\t2\t73576\t2\t73589\t2\t73589\t2\t73589\t2\t73597\t2\t735800\t2\t735808\t2\t735821\t2\t735828\t2\t735102\t2\t735111\t2\t735112\t2\t735163\t2\t735183\t2\t735183\t2\t735184\t2\t735184\t2\t735193\t2\t735193\t2\t735198\t2\t735198\t2\t735198\t2\t735199\t2\t735905\t2\t735907\t2\t735952\t2\t735953\t2\t735977\t2\t735983\t2\t735201\t2\t735203\t2\t735204\t2\t735210\t2\t735225\t2\t735255\t2\t735269\t2\t7351016\t2\t7351023\t2\t7351030\t2\t7351055\t2\t7351055\t2\t7351087\t2\t7351087\t2\t7351089\t2\t7351090\t2\t7351135\t2\t7351209\t2\t7351210\t2\t7351260\t2\t7351260\t2\t7351275\t2\t7351275\t2\t7351275\t2\t7351275\t2\t7351276\t2\t7351276\t2\t7351278\t2\t7351280\t2\t7351283\t2\t7351285\t2\t7351285\t2\t7351286\t2\t7351287\t2\t7351290\t2\t7351298\t2\t7351302\t2\t7351302\t2\t7351302\t2\t7351335\t2\t7351355\t2\t7351390\t2\t7351397\t2\t7351397\t2\t7351417\t2\t7351428\t2\t7351432\t2\t7351432\t2\t735373\t2\t735379\t2\t735",

Giering has indicated several different ways inwhich one can view a data base as being large.  It can belarge in terms of having a large number of entries orrecords (or bibliographic references).  It can be large inthe sense of having a large number of fields or dataelements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can bethought of as large in the sense of having a large numberof searchable or selectable elements, and it also can belarge in the most readily understandable sense of havinga large number of characters in storage..X432\t2\t736450\t2\t736451\t2\t736452\t2\t736459\t2\t736459\t2\t736459\t2\t736460\t2\t736461\t2\t736468\t2\t736484\t2\t736492\t2\t736506\t2\t736508\t2\t736511\t2\t736512\t2\t736514\t2\t736518\t2\t736520\t2\t736523\t2\t736524\t2\t736524\t2\t736525\t2\t736525\t2\t736526\t2\t736527\t2\t736529\t2\t736529\t2\t736530\t2\t736530\t2\t736534\t2\t736534\t2\t736546\t2\t736553\t2\t736579\t2\t736580\t2\t736594\t2\t736603\t2\t736604\t2\t736606\t2\t736609\t2\t736610\t2\t736611\t2\t736612\t2\t736622\t2\t736625\t2\t736626\t2\t736630\t2\t736633\t2\t736634\t2\t736635\t2\t736636\t2\t736636\t2\t736637\t2\t736637\t2\t736642\t2\t736642\t2\t736642\t2\t736642\t2\t736643\t2\t736643\t2\t736644\t2\t736645\t2\t736646\t2\t736648\t2\t736648\t2\t736649\t2\t736650\t2\t736650\t2\t736692\t2\t736696\t2\t736696\t2\t736699\t2\t73618\t2\t736702\t2\t736703\t2\t736703\t2\t736705\t2\t736705\t2\t736708\t2\t736708\t2\t736726\t2\t736727\t2\t736728\t2\t736730\t2\t736731\t2\t736732\t2\t736732\t2\t736733\t2\t736733\t2\t736734\t2\t736734\t2\t736734\t2\t736736\t2\t736736\t2\t736736\t2\t736736\t2\t736736\t2\t736737\t2\t736738\t2\t736738\t2\t736739\t2\t736739\t2\t736740\t2\t736741\t2\t736741\t2\t736742\t2\t736742\t2\t736743\t2\t736743\t2\t736744\t2\t736755\t2\t736795\t2\t736820\t2\t736826\t2\t736826\t2\t736826\t2\t736827\t2\t736827\t2\t736877\t2\t736879\t2\t736879\t2\t736883\t2\t736883\t2\t736120\t2\t736124\t2\t736124\t2\t736125\t2\t736127\t2\t736127\t2\t736127\t2\t736129\t2\t736129\t2\t736145\t2\t736190\t2\t736191\t2\t736197\t2\t736197\t2\t736211\t2\t736214\t2\t736218\t2\t736243\t2\t7361004\t2\t7361035\t2\t7361078\t2\t7361089\t2\t7361091\t2\t7361146\t2\t7361207\t2\t7361264\t2\t7361297\t2\t7361303\t2\t7361356\t2\t7361364\t2\t7361368\t2\t7361370\t2\t7361370\t2\t7361372\t2\t7361372\t2\t7361373\t2\t7361374\t2\t7361374\t2\t7361374\t2\t7361375\t2\t7361375\t2\t7361376\t2\t7361376\t2\t7361377\t2\t7361383\t2\t7361396\t2\t736307\t2\t736330\t2\t736357\t2\t736363\t2\t736376\t2\t736378\t2\t736382\t2\t736",

It thenaddresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorilyresolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under activeinvestigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One iscalled the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old techniquecalled super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and hasrecently been installed in an operational system.

    "author": "Fisanick, W.Mitchell, L.D.Scott, J.A.Vander Stouw, G.G.",
    "words": "The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemicalnomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the developmentof methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclatureterms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Indexnomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topologicalsearches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety ofsearches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also containnonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance datacan often be done within a single search of a file with both high recalland relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possiblefor persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to constructnomenclature profiles for many questions..X432\t2\t738450\t2\t738451\t2\t738452\t2\t738459\t2\t738460\t2\t738461\t2\t738468\t2\t738484\t2\t738492\t2\t738508\t2\t738511\t2\t738512\t2\t738514\t2\t738518\t2\t738520\t2\t738523\t2\t738524\t2\t738525\t2\t738526\t2\t738529\t2\t738530\t2\t738534\t2\t738546\t2\t738553\t2\t738579\t2\t738580\t2\t738594\t2\t738603\t2\t738604\t2\t738606\t2\t738609\t2\t738610\t2\t738611\t2\t738612\t2\t738622\t2\t738625\t2\t738626\t2\t738630\t2\t738636\t2\t738637\t2\t738641\t2\t738642\t2\t738642\t2\t738643\t2\t738644\t2\t738645\t2\t738646\t2\t738648\t2\t738649\t2\t738650\t2\t738650\t2\t738668\t2\t738670\t2\t738671\t2\t738673\t2\t738677\t2\t738678\t2\t738679\t2\t738682\t2\t738689\t2\t738690\t2\t738692\t2\t738693\t2\t738694\t2\t738695\t2\t738696\t2\t738698\t2\t738699\t2\t738699\t2\t738700\t2\t738700\t2\t738701\t2\t738702\t2\t738702\t2\t738703\t2\t738704\t2\t738705\t2\t738706\t2\t738707\t2\t738707\t2\t738708\t2\t738708\t2\t738709\t2\t738709\t2\t738710\t2\t738726\t2\t738727\t2\t738728\t2\t738730\t2\t738731\t2\t738731\t2\t738732\t2\t738733\t2\t738733\t2\t738734\t2\t738734\t2\t738736\t2\t738736\t2\t738737\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738738\t2\t738739\t2\t738739\t2\t738740\t2\t738741\t2\t738741\t2\t738741\t2\t738742\t2\t738742\t2\t738743\t2\t738744\t2\t738755\t2\t738820\t2\t738826\t2\t738827\t2\t738833\t2\t738879\t2\t738883\t2\t738116\t2\t738117\t2\t738124\t2\t738125\t2\t738127\t2\t738127\t2\t738129\t2\t738129\t2\t738190\t2\t738191\t2\t738197\t2\t738211\t2\t738214\t2\t738218\t2\t738243\t2\t738254\t2\t7381004\t2\t7381026\t2\t7381035\t2\t7381072\t2\t7381078\t2\t7381089\t2\t7381091\t2\t7381207\t2\t7381264\t2\t7381292\t2\t7381297\t2\t7381303\t2\t7381356\t2\t7381364\t2\t7381368\t2\t7381370\t2\t7381372\t2\t7381373\t2\t7381374\t2\t7381374\t2\t7381375\t2\t7381376\t2\t7381376\t2\t7381377\t2\t7381448\t2\t7381452\t2\t738307\t2\t738327\t2\t738330\t2\t738363\t2\t738378\t2\t738",

    "author": "Zadeh, L. A.",
    "words": "A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very,more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operatorwhich acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. Forexample, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very actson the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man..To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define severalelementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations maybe built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximaterepresentation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations ascomplementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrastintensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc..Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I,e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximatedby an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II,e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge ismore  complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the componentsof its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedgerequires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of itsoperand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether itfalls into category I or II..The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations forseveral relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly,etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent,require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is morequalitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper...X417\t2\t745417\t2\t745417\t2\t745430\t2\t745430\t2\t745430\t2\t745430\t2\t745443\t2\t745443\t2\t745443\t2\t745443\t2\t745455\t2\t745455\t2\t745455\t2\t745455\t2\t745455\t2\t745455\t2\t745464\t2\t745464\t2\t745464\t2\t745745\t2\t745745\t2\t745745\t2\t745745\t2\t745745\t2\t745745\t2\t74561\t2\t745175\t2\t745175\t2\t7451204\t2\t7451204\t2\t7451204\t2\t7451398\t2\t7451398\t2\t7451398\t2\t7451398\t2\t7451427\t2\t7451427\t2\t7451427\t2\t745310\t2\t745318\t2\t745397\t2\t745397\t2\t745397\t2\t745",

    "words": "It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presentedwhich appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverserelationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly notnew; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA andABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not-Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising fromCranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that thesimple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test resultscoming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II madefurther modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forwardto read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence ofsubsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expecteddecreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the resultsof a number of different searches are averaged.

This investigation shows why and how an artificiallycreated scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with currentdevelopments and thus points to the source of natural language..X422\t2\t755441\t2\t755450\t2\t755451\t2\t755452\t2\t755459\t2\t755468\t2\t755484\t2\t755492\t2\t755508\t2\t755510\t2\t755511\t2\t755512\t2\t755514\t2\t755514\t2\t755518\t2\t755520\t2\t755520\t2\t755523\t2\t755524\t2\t755525\t2\t755526\t2\t755529\t2\t755530\t2\t755534\t2\t755546\t2\t755553\t2\t755577\t2\t755579\t2\t755582\t2\t755594\t2\t755603\t2\t755603\t2\t755604\t2\t755606\t2\t755609\t2\t755610\t2\t755611\t2\t755612\t2\t755625\t2\t755626\t2\t755630\t2\t755636\t2\t755637\t2\t755641\t2\t755642\t2\t755643\t2\t755644\t2\t755645\t2\t755648\t2\t755649\t2\t755650\t2\t755650\t2\t755692\t2\t755696\t2\t755699\t2\t75538\t2\t755703\t2\t755705\t2\t755708\t2\t755709\t2\t755726\t2\t755726\t2\t755727\t2\t755728\t2\t755731\t2\t755732\t2\t755733\t2\t755734\t2\t755736\t2\t755738\t2\t755739\t2\t755740\t2\t755741\t2\t755742\t2\t755743\t2\t755744\t2\t755755\t2\t755755\t2\t755755\t2\t755755\t2\t755755\t2\t755813\t2\t755820\t2\t755820\t2\t755822\t2\t755825\t2\t755826\t2\t755827\t2\t755827\t2\t755830\t2\t755879\t2\t755883\t2\t755124\t2\t755127\t2\t755129\t2\t755190\t2\t755191\t2\t755197\t2\t755211\t2\t755214\t2\t755218\t2\t755243\t2\t7551004\t2\t7551035\t2\t7551078\t2\t7551084\t2\t7551089\t2\t7551091\t2\t7551091\t2\t7551207\t2\t7551264\t2\t7551297\t2\t7551303\t2\t7551356\t2\t7551364\t2\t7551368\t2\t7551370\t2\t7551372\t2\t7551373\t2\t7551374\t2\t7551375\t2\t7551376\t2\t7551377\t2\t7551448\t2\t755307\t2\t755324\t2\t755330\t2\t755378\t2\t755",

From adiscussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is theonly knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction fromempirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only fourbasic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, andcausation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in alinear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutationsof such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement ofthe first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then beconstructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such aninductively constructed classification is the only true representation of thestructure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple techniquefor accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, withcomplete flexibility...X476\t2\t758477\t2\t758478\t2\t758478\t2\t758480\t2\t758480\t2\t758516\t2\t758516\t2\t758542\t2\t758758\t2\t758758\t2\t758758\t2\t758758\t2\t758758\t2\t758785\t2\t758160\t2\t758258\t2\t758259\t2\t7581215\t2\t7581231\t2\t7581259\t2\t7581391\t2\t7581391\t2\t7581405\t2\t758",

Bradford listed the journals concerned in orderof decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulativetotals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced,he obtained a straight line.  (Similar results have been obtained by many laterworkers.  The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distributionof references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study ofliterature usage in the petroleum industry.)  On the basis of these resultsBradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe referencescattering.

In numerous papers we are told how most publishedliterature becomes obsolete within a measurable time, and that an item receiveshalf the uses it will ever receive ('half-life') in a few years.  'Obsolescence'is however very rarely defined, and its validity, interest, and practical valueare often assumed rather than explained.

Other items covered by the survey include the useof libraries in Halls of resinence and of Southampton Public Libraries, which inboth cases showed a sharp decline since 1962, the number and cost of booksbought by undergraduates, and their use of libraries in vacations...X2\t2\t7744\t2\t7744\t2\t7749\t2\t774415\t2\t774418\t2\t774456\t2\t774475\t2\t774552\t2\t774648\t2\t77431\t2\t77432\t2\t77436\t2\t77441\t2\t77446\t2\t774760\t2\t774760\t2\t774767\t2\t774768\t2\t774768\t2\t774768\t2\t774768\t2\t774774\t2\t774774\t2\t774774\t2\t774774\t2\t774774\t2\t774774\t2\t774775\t2\t774778\t2\t774783\t2\t774788\t2\t774789\t2\t774799\t2\t77476\t2\t77496\t2\t774811\t2\t774816\t2\t774818\t2\t774823\t2\t774839\t2\t774842\t2\t774843\t2\t774844\t2\t774847\t2\t774891\t2\t774132\t2\t774137\t2\t774137\t2\t774139\t2\t774152\t2\t774155\t2\t774163\t2\t774181\t2\t774182\t2\t774183\t2\t774183\t2\t774184\t2\t774193\t2\t774195\t2\t774195\t2\t774198\t2\t774905\t2\t774913\t2\t774952\t2\t774953\t2\t774961\t2\t774962\t2\t774964\t2\t774964\t2\t774968\t2\t774968\t2\t774977\t2\t774201\t2\t774203\t2\t774204\t2\t774207\t2\t774210\t2\t774269\t2\t774293\t2\t774298\t2\t7741009\t2\t7741018\t2\t7741019\t2\t7741055\t2\t7741056\t2\t7741068\t2\t7741069\t2\t7741070\t2\t7741203\t2\t7741214\t2\t7741240\t2\t7741246\t2\t7741321\t2\t7741359\t2\t7741397\t2\t7741401\t2\t7741407\t2\t7741417\t2\t7741445\t2\t7741451\t2\t774370\t2\t774395\t2\t774",

    "words": "In a previous paper (J. Doc. 20 (4) 1964, 212-35) a series of tests onthe coverage, overlap, and indexing of abstracts journals were described.Briefly, these were carried out by selecting recent, comprehensivebibliographies on specific subjects, searching the appropriate abstractsjournals via the author indexes to determine the number of references givenin the bibliography that were abstracted, then consulting the subjectindexes to try to locate those references which are known to have beenabstracted.  A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and theresults are reported here.Our results are presented below in the following form:1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references,reports, etc.).2. Abstracts journals consulted.3. Coverage and multiple coverage.  This is a bar-chart showing number ofreferences not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on.4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last columnshowing coverage by all services combined.  (Where bar-charts are giventhey show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actualnumbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns.5. Taking each abstracts journal separately, we show the headings underwhich references were found in the subject index.

Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen yearsold rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  Thenet increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwisebe expected.Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending tohave its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off fromthe classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on averagebe adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information)by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the maintheme, associated concepts and methods, and general background..X545\t2\t784552\t2\t784552\t2\t784587\t2\t784605\t2\t784613\t2\t784614\t2\t784632\t2\t784638\t2\t78433\t2\t78433\t2\t78436\t2\t78439\t2\t78441\t2\t78448\t2\t784735\t2\t784735\t2\t784735\t2\t784747\t2\t784750\t2\t784753\t2\t784766\t2\t784766\t2\t784767\t2\t784775\t2\t784782\t2\t784784\t2\t784784\t2\t784784\t2\t784784\t2\t784784\t2\t784788\t2\t784789\t2\t784793\t2\t78476\t2\t78489\t2\t78489\t2\t78489\t2\t78489\t2\t78497\t2\t784800\t2\t784808\t2\t784828\t2\t784102\t2\t784111\t2\t784112\t2\t784113\t2\t784163\t2\t784183\t2\t784183\t2\t784184\t2\t784184\t2\t784193\t2\t784193\t2\t784198\t2\t784199\t2\t784905\t2\t784953\t2\t784977\t2\t784983\t2\t784201\t2\t784203\t2\t784204\t2\t784210\t2\t784225\t2\t784233\t2\t784269\t2\t7841016\t2\t7841023\t2\t7841030\t2\t7841055\t2\t7841055\t2\t7841087\t2\t7841082\t2\t7841090\t2\t7841135\t2\t7841260\t2\t7841273\t2\t7841275\t2\t7841275\t2\t7841276\t2\t7841278\t2\t7841280\t2\t7841283\t2\t7841285\t2\t7841285\t2\t7841286\t2\t7841286\t2\t7841287\t2\t7841287\t2\t7841302\t2\t7841302\t2\t7841335\t2\t7841335\t2\t7841338\t2\t7841341\t2\t7841341\t2\t7841346\t2\t7841347\t2\t7841390\t2\t7841397\t2\t7841397\t2\t7841417\t2\t7841428\t2\t7841432\t2\t7841432\t2\t7841444\t2\t784373\t2\t784",

    "words": "The paper presents the results of a survey of the use of social scienceperiodicals carried out at the National Lending Library during a period of fourweeks in 1968..Three-quarters of the requests came from universities and industrialorganizations and over 90% of the requests were for English languagepublications.. Over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles.. Therewere marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types oforganizations and although the overall 'half-life' of the literature proved tobe 3 1/2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another..Concerning the sources of references, it was discovered that compared withscientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use ofabstracting and indexing publications..Appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey, a list oftitle requested six or more times, and a list of abstracting and indexingpublications cited five or more times as sources of references...X2\t2\t788475\t2\t788475\t2\t788486\t2\t788545\t2\t788545\t2\t788552\t2\t788552\t2\t788587\t2\t788605\t2\t788613\t2\t788614\t2\t788638\t2\t788658\t2\t788658\t2\t78810\t2\t78824\t2\t78833\t2\t78836\t2\t78841\t2\t788716\t2\t788720\t2\t788735\t2\t788747\t2\t788748\t2\t788748\t2\t788750\t2\t788753\t2\t788760\t2\t788760\t2\t788763\t2\t788766\t2\t788767\t2\t788771\t2\t788774\t2\t788775\t2\t788775\t2\t788782\t2\t788782\t2\t788784\t2\t788785\t2\t788786\t2\t788787\t2\t788787\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788788\t2\t788789\t2\t788789\t2\t788789\t2\t788789\t2\t788789\t2\t788789\t2\t788789\t2\t788791\t2\t788793\t2\t78862\t2\t78865\t2\t78866\t2\t78871\t2\t78872\t2\t78874\t2\t78875\t2\t78875\t2\t78876\t2\t78876\t2\t78877\t2\t78878\t2\t78879\t2\t78873\t2\t78881\t2\t78882\t2\t78883\t2\t78886\t2\t78889\t2\t78897\t2\t788800\t2\t788808\t2\t788837\t2\t788840\t2\t788102\t2\t788110\t2\t788111\t2\t788111\t2\t788112\t2\t788132\t2\t788137\t2\t788137\t2\t788139\t2\t788147\t2\t788152\t2\t788153\t2\t788155\t2\t788155\t2\t788156\t2\t788163\t2\t788183\t2\t788183\t2\t788184\t2\t788193\t2\t788195\t2\t788199\t2\t788905\t2\t788925\t2\t788925\t2\t788953\t2\t788977\t2\t788977\t2\t788983\t2\t788984\t2\t788986\t2\t788203\t2\t788203\t2\t788204\t2\t788210\t2\t788210\t2\t788210\t2\t788210\t2\t788210\t2\t788211\t2\t788212\t2\t788225\t2\t788245\t2\t788269\t2\t788277\t2\t788278\t2\t788279\t2\t788279\t2\t788280\t2\t788280\t2\t7881016\t2\t7881023\t2\t7881030\t2\t7881050\t2\t7881055\t2\t7881055\t2\t7881055\t2\t7881056\t2\t7881083\t2\t7881085\t2\t7881087\t2\t7881090\t2\t7881135\t2\t7881254\t2\t7881254\t2\t7881260\t2\t7881275\t2\t7881275\t2\t7881276\t2\t7881278\t2\t7881280\t2\t7881285\t2\t7881286\t2\t7881287\t2\t7881291\t2\t7881302\t2\t7881335\t2\t7881361\t2\t7881390\t2\t7881390\t2\t7881397\t2\t7881400\t2\t7881404\t2\t7881404\t2\t7881417\t2\t7881428\t2\t7881432\t2\t7881451\t2\t7881451\t2\t788355\t2\t788359\t2\t788373\t2\t788386\t2\t788395\t2\t788398\t2\t788",

    "words": "Since 1960, and especially during the past three years, many papers haveappeared about particular manifestations and applications of a certain classof empirical laws to a field that may be labelled conveniently 'Bibliometrics'.This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes,in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recordeddiscourse and behaviour appertaining to it.In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford orZipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodicalliterature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in thecumulative yield from a given input.  The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is,the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type ofbehaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging frommeteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanationsappropriate to the particular fields.

    "words": "The expression 'half-life', borrowed from physics, has appearedquite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960, when anarticle by Burton and Kebler on The 'half-life' of some scientific and technicalliteratures was published, although it had certainly been used previously.Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather thandisintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half theactive life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time duringwhich one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerousstudies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establishobsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points outthat different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample ofliterature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accuratemeasures for discriminating between different subject-fields..X456\t2\t793456\t2\t793545\t2\t793545\t2\t793552\t2\t793560\t2\t793587\t2\t793587\t2\t793587\t2\t793587\t2\t793587\t2\t793587\t2\t793587\t2\t793588\t2\t793605\t2\t793613\t2\t793614\t2\t793614\t2\t793614\t2\t793614\t2\t793638\t2\t793638\t2\t793651\t2\t793667\t2\t79333\t2\t79333\t2\t79333\t2\t79333\t2\t79336\t2\t79336\t2\t79341\t2\t79348\t2\t793735\t2\t793747\t2\t793747\t2\t793748\t2\t793748\t2\t793750\t2\t793750\t2\t793750\t2\t793750\t2\t793751\t2\t793751\t2\t793753\t2\t793759\t2\t793765\t2\t793765\t2\t793766\t2\t793767\t2\t793767\t2\t793767\t2\t79357\t2\t793775\t2\t793775\t2\t793775\t2\t793778\t2\t793778\t2\t793782\t2\t793784\t2\t793786\t2\t793787\t2\t793788\t2\t793789\t2\t793791\t2\t793791\t2\t793792\t2\t793792\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793793\t2\t793794\t2\t793794\t2\t793794\t2\t793794\t2\t793794\t2\t79388\t2\t79389\t2\t79397\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793800\t2\t793808\t2\t793808\t2\t793808\t2\t793808\t2\t793811\t2\t793102\t2\t793102\t2\t793103\t2\t793104\t2\t793106\t2\t793106\t2\t793106\t2\t793110\t2\t793111\t2\t793111\t2\t793111\t2\t793111\t2\t793112\t2\t793112\t2\t793112\t2\t793113\t2\t793113\t2\t793155\t2\t793163\t2\t793170\t2\t793183\t2\t793184\t2\t793184\t2\t793193\t2\t793193\t2\t793195\t2\t793199\t2\t793905\t2\t793925\t2\t793948\t2\t793953\t2\t793977\t2\t793983\t2\t793983\t2\t793201\t2\t793203\t2\t793203\t2\t793204\t2\t793205\t2\t793210\t2\t793225\t2\t793233\t2\t793267\t2\t793267\t2\t793269\t2\t7931010\t2\t7931016\t2\t7931019\t2\t7931023\t2\t7931030\t2\t7931055\t2\t7931062\t2\t7931081\t2\t7931083\t2\t7931085\t2\t7931086\t2\t7931086\t2\t7931087\t2\t7931087\t2\t7931082\t2\t7931090\t2\t7931090\t2\t7931090\t2\t7931135\t2\t7931201\t2\t7931222\t2\t7931260\t2\t7931275\t2\t7931276\t2\t7931278\t2\t7931278\t2\t7931280\t2\t7931285\t2\t7931285\t2\t7931285\t2\t7931285\t2\t7931285\t2\t7931286\t2\t7931287\t2\t7931287\t2\t7931287\t2\t7931291\t2\t7931302\t2\t7931308\t2\t7931335\t2\t7931335\t2\t7931340\t2\t7931344\t2\t7931346\t2\t7931347\t2\t7931390\t2\t7931397\t2\t7931401\t2\t7931417\t2\t7931417\t2\t7931418\t2\t7931428\t2\t7931432\t2\t793314\t2\t793359\t2\t793373\t2\t793395\t2\t793",

    "words": "Thirty years or more ago, a favoured question in examination papersfor librarians was some variation on the theme 'Compare the merits of aclassified catalogue and an alphabetical subject catalogue'.  This was asubject which it was possible to write on or to discuss at great length,advancing a number of theoretical arguments or opinions expressed by pundits,without ever stating a single demonstratable fact.  When, in the early 1950's,various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques forindexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that itappeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments.  In aneditorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint,shared by many others, when he wrote:Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results isessential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems.  Maythe age-old controversies that arose from the conventional conceptsof classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systemsof the future.  There is hope for the avoidance of such errors ifwe will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, thebenefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by theintelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs andcosts.  The machines of the future can make us free, but only if weare willing to subject them, and ourselves, to the most rigidintellectual discipline..X486\t2\t795488\t2\t795489\t2\t795490\t2\t795491\t2\t795492\t2\t795495\t2\t795496\t2\t795497\t2\t795493\t2\t795499\t2\t795494\t2\t795500\t2\t795506\t2\t795558\t2\t795565\t2\t795572\t2\t795581\t2\t795583\t2\t795584\t2\t795586\t2\t795625\t2\t795628\t2\t795633\t2\t795634\t2\t795643\t2\t795659\t2\t795659\t2\t795696\t2\t79538\t2\t795705\t2\t795736\t2\t795752\t2\t795781\t2\t795789\t2\t795796\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795795\t2\t795798\t2\t79572\t2\t79572\t2\t79584\t2\t795801\t2\t795814\t2\t795824\t2\t795826\t2\t795120\t2\t795149\t2\t795160\t2\t795197\t2\t795901\t2\t795902\t2\t795907\t2\t795906\t2\t795986\t2\t7951089\t2\t7951202\t2\t7951209\t2\t7951218\t2\t7951250\t2\t7951255\t2\t7951289\t2\t7951294\t2\t7951294\t2\t7951414\t2\t7951422\t2\t795382\t2\t795382\t2\t795",

Thisimplies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the wholeoperation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assumingthat we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to berelevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition ofparticular classes and their relations.

A novel feature of the system is theintegration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appearsboth in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term isdisplayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplementsthis information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationshipswhich cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls wordforms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers..The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangementand conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing andcomputerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certaintraditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplinesfor main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, incertain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-termconcepts..

An English translation wascircularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper,they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by ProfessorJ.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information inwhich Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation','documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider thatInformatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information,only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitionsfor 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity','information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up theirproposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, andthe title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal,which is now called Informatiki..X3\t2\t803447\t2\t803449\t2\t803456\t2\t803457\t2\t803469\t2\t803505\t2\t803574\t2\t803585\t2\t803585\t2\t803599\t2\t803599\t2\t803607\t2\t803625\t2\t803640\t2\t803652\t2\t803665\t2\t803665\t2\t80315\t2\t80320\t2\t80342\t2\t803762\t2\t80360\t2\t80385\t2\t80385\t2\t803803\t2\t803803\t2\t803803\t2\t803803\t2\t803803\t2\t803803\t2\t803803\t2\t803129\t2\t803152\t2\t803172\t2\t803911\t2\t803228\t2\t8031022\t2\t8031022\t2\t8031045\t2\t8031082\t2\t8031218\t2\t8031268\t2\t8031309\t2\t8031309\t2\t8031319\t2\t8031386\t2\t803313\t2\t803345\t2\t803361\t2\t803",

The survey has alreadybeen installed at four university libraries, but the results from only onelibrary are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find outthe degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library,the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demandand not available..They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers,the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap ofdemand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time forbooks that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period oftime, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failurefrom one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside thelibrary..From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in libraryprocedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of booksfailing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library..

It isargued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so thatmatches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matcheson frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerableimprovements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure...X419\t2\t812419\t2\t812419\t2\t812440\t2\t812441\t2\t812445\t2\t812448\t2\t812448\t2\t812449\t2\t812452\t2\t812452\t2\t812453\t2\t812466\t2\t812467\t2\t812468\t2\t812480\t2\t812483\t2\t812484\t2\t812484\t2\t812486\t2\t812488\t2\t812491\t2\t812495\t2\t812493\t2\t812503\t2\t812506\t2\t812507\t2\t812508\t2\t812509\t2\t812509\t2\t812510\t2\t812511\t2\t812511\t2\t812512\t2\t812512\t2\t812514\t2\t812516\t2\t812517\t2\t812517\t2\t812518\t2\t812518\t2\t812520\t2\t812520\t2\t812521\t2\t812521\t2\t812522\t2\t812522\t2\t812523\t2\t812523\t2\t812524\t2\t812526\t2\t812526\t2\t812527\t2\t812527\t2\t812528\t2\t812528\t2\t812528\t2\t812529\t2\t812531\t2\t812531\t2\t812531\t2\t812531\t2\t812531\t2\t812565\t2\t812565\t2\t812565\t2\t812565\t2\t812566\t2\t812566\t2\t812572\t2\t812575\t2\t812575\t2\t812576\t2\t812577\t2\t812577\t2\t812577\t2\t812580\t2\t812581\t2\t812595\t2\t812596\t2\t812596\t2\t812603\t2\t812604\t2\t812608\t2\t812608\t2\t812609\t2\t812610\t2\t812612\t2\t812615\t2\t812619\t2\t812619\t2\t812622\t2\t812623\t2\t812625\t2\t812625\t2\t812625\t2\t812626\t2\t812629\t2\t812631\t2\t812632\t2\t812633\t2\t812633\t2\t812634\t2\t812634\t2\t812636\t2\t812643\t2\t812644\t2\t812644\t2\t812649\t2\t812649\t2\t812652\t2\t812659\t2\t812659\t2\t812660\t2\t812660\t2\t812660\t2\t812662\t2\t812699\t2\t81218\t2\t81226\t2\t812700\t2\t812700\t2\t812705\t2\t812705\t2\t812707\t2\t812707\t2\t812715\t2\t812723\t2\t812726\t2\t812727\t2\t812727\t2\t812728\t2\t812729\t2\t812730\t2\t812731\t2\t812752\t2\t812752\t2\t812752\t2\t812754\t2\t812754\t2\t812754\t2\t812754\t2\t81251\t2\t81251\t2\t81257\t2\t81257\t2\t81257\t2\t812780\t2\t812780\t2\t812780\t2\t812785\t2\t812790\t2\t81269\t2\t81271\t2\t81275\t2\t81275\t2\t81277\t2\t81279\t2\t81279\t2\t81273\t2\t81273\t2\t812805\t2\t812809\t2\t812810\t2\t812810\t2\t812810\t2\t812810\t2\t812810\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812812\t2\t812813\t2\t812813\t2\t812813\t2\t812814\t2\t812814\t2\t812814\t2\t812814\t2\t812814\t2\t812817\t2\t812817\t2\t812817\t2\t812820\t2\t812822\t2\t812824\t2\t812824\t2\t812824\t2\t812824\t2\t812824\t2\t812825\t2\t812829\t2\t812830\t2\t812866\t2\t812870\t2\t812870\t2\t812873\t2\t812875\t2\t812894\t2\t812894\t2\t812894\t2\t812895\t2\t812124\t2\t812125\t2\t812125\t2\t812145\t2\t812165\t2\t812168\t2\t812175\t2\t812176\t2\t812176\t2\t812176\t2\t812928\t2\t812956\t2\t812963\t2\t812990\t2\t812991\t2\t812211\t2\t812274\t2\t8121051\t2\t8121078\t2\t8121089\t2\t8121091\t2\t8121143\t2\t8121255\t2\t8121264\t2\t8121282\t2\t8121282\t2\t8121294\t2\t8121294\t2\t8121302\t2\t8121303\t2\t8121303\t2\t8121307\t2\t8121327\t2\t8121327\t2\t8121327\t2\t8121327\t2\t8121364\t2\t8121366\t2\t8121366\t2\t8121367\t2\t8121367\t2\t8121368\t2\t8121368\t2\t8121396\t2\t8121413\t2\t8121419\t2\t8121427\t2\t8121445\t2\t812315\t2\t812315\t2\t812329\t2\t812378\t2\t812381\t2\t812382\t2\t812389\t2\t812390\t2\t812",

The cost of the database to subscribers is a known quantity, and the coverage is decided by the database producers..This paper describes an investigation into the relative performance of thefour major Chemical Abstracts Service magnetic tape data-base, Chemical Titles(CT), which contains the titles of citations only, Chemical AbstractsCondensates (CAC), which contains titles enriched with keyword phrases,Chemical-Biological Activities (CBAC),and Polymer Science and Technology (POST),both of which contain full digests in addition to titles..The performance was measured in terms of the relative currency of the fourdata-bases, on the retrieval efficiency of profiles searched against them..Fifty questions from industrial and government research organizations were usedin the experiment.. Search profiles corresponding to these questions wereconstructed for searching against each database, output was assessed forrelevance by users, and profile performance figures (precision and recallratios) were calculated for each profile..

    "words": "This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method ofinvestigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on theshelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find..The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers wereasked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical theywere looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status,and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis ofthese 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader'sfailure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern offailure for different groups of volumes..A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during thefortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on theeffect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whetherhe found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and whatproportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could bechecked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each withits own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. Thesedifferences were reflected in the results obtained..It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed bylibrarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their ownlibraries...X4\t2\t8164\t2\t8165\t2\t8165\t2\t8169\t2\t8169\t2\t816456\t2\t816515\t2\t816535\t2\t816591\t2\t816625\t2\t816629\t2\t816631\t2\t816634\t2\t816638\t2\t81632\t2\t816764\t2\t816764\t2\t816766\t2\t816768\t2\t816774\t2\t816783\t2\t816791\t2\t816799\t2\t81696\t2\t816811\t2\t816811\t2\t816811\t2\t816811\t2\t816811\t2\t816811\t2\t816811\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816816\t2\t816818\t2\t816818\t2\t816823\t2\t816823\t2\t816842\t2\t816842\t2\t816843\t2\t816844\t2\t816846\t2\t816115\t2\t816137\t2\t816163\t2\t816913\t2\t816915\t2\t816925\t2\t816925\t2\t816944\t2\t816948\t2\t816959\t2\t816960\t2\t816961\t2\t816961\t2\t816961\t2\t816962\t2\t816962\t2\t816962\t2\t816962\t2\t816964\t2\t816964\t2\t816964\t2\t816964\t2\t816968\t2\t816994\t2\t816994\t2\t816207\t2\t816207\t2\t816207\t2\t816207\t2\t816208\t2\t816217\t2\t816222\t2\t816222\t2\t816223\t2\t816223\t2\t816234\t2\t816234\t2\t816245\t2\t816245\t2\t816296\t2\t816297\t2\t816298\t2\t8161015\t2\t8161023\t2\t8161068\t2\t8161203\t2\t8161242\t2\t8161247\t2\t8161257\t2\t8161268\t2\t8161321\t2\t8161354\t2\t8161400\t2\t8161407\t2\t8161445\t2\t816300\t2\t816301\t2\t816302\t2\t816358\t2\t816364\t2\t816364\t2\t816364\t2\t816365\t2\t816",

    "words": "The task of the librarian is to achieve his library's objectives.  Asimplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectivesare defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meetthe needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in anyservice organization is likely to be an iterative process, but theexplicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept maybe) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first stepto determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in userbehaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted todrawing together some threads of research of potential application inuniversity libraries.

The visual service was found to beproviding an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%,to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and oflower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily..In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words ontitles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixtyusers of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which weregenerated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words intitles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching..Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. Theaverage precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Indexterms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missedmany relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58%of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%..No significant effects of document types or subject on the relativeeffectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results wereanalyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with alower precision..A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed bycomputer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was madeto identify reasons for failure...X421\t2\t820433\t2\t820440\t2\t820450\t2\t820451\t2\t820452\t2\t820452\t2\t820453\t2\t820459\t2\t820459\t2\t820465\t2\t820466\t2\t820467\t2\t820468\t2\t820468\t2\t820468\t2\t820484\t2\t820490\t2\t820491\t2\t820492\t2\t820495\t2\t820506\t2\t820506\t2\t820507\t2\t820508\t2\t820508\t2\t820510\t2\t820510\t2\t820510\t2\t820511\t2\t820511\t2\t820512\t2\t820512\t2\t820512\t2\t820514\t2\t820514\t2\t820514\t2\t820514\t2\t820514\t2\t820517\t2\t820518\t2\t820518\t2\t820520\t2\t820520\t2\t820520\t2\t820520\t2\t820521\t2\t820523\t2\t820523\t2\t820524\t2\t820524\t2\t820525\t2\t820526\t2\t820526\t2\t820528\t2\t820529\t2\t820530\t2\t820534\t2\t820534\t2\t820546\t2\t820553\t2\t820570\t2\t820576\t2\t820576\t2\t820579\t2\t820580\t2\t820582\t2\t820586\t2\t820589\t2\t820591\t2\t820594\t2\t820595\t2\t820595\t2\t820603\t2\t820603\t2\t820603\t2\t820603\t2\t820604\t2\t820604\t2\t820604\t2\t820606\t2\t820608\t2\t820609\t2\t820609\t2\t820610\t2\t820611\t2\t820612\t2\t820612\t2\t820615\t2\t820619\t2\t820622\t2\t820622\t2\t820623\t2\t820623\t2\t820625\t2\t820626\t2\t820629\t2\t820629\t2\t820630\t2\t820631\t2\t820632\t2\t820633\t2\t820633\t2\t820636\t2\t820636\t2\t820637\t2\t820639\t2\t820642\t2\t820643\t2\t820646\t2\t820648\t2\t820650\t2\t820659\t2\t820659\t2\t820676\t2\t820692\t2\t820696\t2\t820699\t2\t820699\t2\t82010\t2\t82018\t2\t82018\t2\t82028\t2\t82034\t2\t82038\t2\t82049\t2\t820700\t2\t820702\t2\t820703\t2\t820705\t2\t820705\t2\t820707\t2\t820708\t2\t820711\t2\t820722\t2\t820723\t2\t820723\t2\t820726\t2\t820726\t2\t820726\t2\t820726\t2\t820726\t2\t820727\t2\t820727\t2\t820728\t2\t820728\t2\t820728\t2\t820729\t2\t820730\t2\t820730\t2\t820731\t2\t820731\t2\t820731\t2\t820731\t2\t820732\t2\t820732\t2\t820732\t2\t820733\t2\t820734\t2\t820736\t2\t820738\t2\t820739\t2\t820740\t2\t820741\t2\t820742\t2\t820743\t2\t820744\t2\t820752\t2\t820754\t2\t820755\t2\t820755\t2\t82053\t2\t82059\t2\t820785\t2\t82086\t2\t820807\t2\t820809\t2\t820810\t2\t820812\t2\t820813\t2\t820813\t2\t820813\t2\t820813\t2\t820814\t2\t820814\t2\t820817\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820820\t2\t820822\t2\t820822\t2\t820822\t2\t820822\t2\t820823\t2\t820825\t2\t820826\t2\t820826\t2\t820827\t2\t820827\t2\t820827\t2\t820827\t2\t820828\t2\t820828\t2\t820829\t2\t820866\t2\t820870\t2\t820870\t2\t820873\t2\t820879\t2\t820879\t2\t820883\t2\t820894\t2\t820895\t2\t820124\t2\t820125\t2\t820127\t2\t820129\t2\t820145\t2\t820150\t2\t820157\t2\t820164\t2\t820175\t2\t820190\t2\t820190\t2\t820191\t2\t820197\t2\t820947\t2\t820948\t2\t820202\t2\t820211\t2\t820211\t2\t820213\t2\t820214\t2\t820218\t2\t820224\t2\t820225\t2\t820243\t2\t820243\t2\t820244\t2\t8201004\t2\t8201017\t2\t8201035\t2\t8201058\t2\t8201078\t2\t8201078\t2\t8201089\t2\t8201089\t2\t8201091\t2\t8201091\t2\t8201091\t2\t8201091\t2\t8201091\t2\t8201143\t2\t8201146\t2\t8201207\t2\t8201230\t2\t8201257\t2\t8201264\t2\t8201264\t2\t8201282\t2\t8201283\t2\t8201297\t2\t8201298\t2\t8201299\t2\t8201302\t2\t8201303\t2\t8201303\t2\t8201313\t2\t8201327\t2\t8201356\t2\t8201363\t2\t8201364\t2\t8201366\t2\t8201366\t2\t8201367\t2\t8201367\t2\t8201368\t2\t8201368\t2\t8201368\t2\t8201370\t2\t8201372\t2\t8201373\t2\t8201374\t2\t8201375\t2\t8201376\t2\t8201377\t2\t8201390\t2\t8201396\t2\t8201396\t2\t8201419\t2\t8201448\t2\t8201448\t2\t820304\t2\t820305\t2\t820306\t2\t820307\t2\t820330\t2\t820358\t2\t820378\t2\t820378\t2\t820381\t2\t820382\t2\t820385\t2\t820389\t2\t820389\t2\t820390\t2\t820394\t2\t820",

    "words": "The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to thestudy of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid andlarge increase has taken place in the research activity in this field andbiophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. Theconsequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created greatdifficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. Tocope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicalsin this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual reviewof biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect theimpact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accuratelythan the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out thepredominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific efforttoday, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemicalmethodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation tosize of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has beendeveloped and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters whichshould be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal inrelation to the number of paper published, compactness of the informationcontent, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness ofpresentation..The results of the present study have been discussed in relation toBradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested,namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in ascientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear inincreasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected thatthe present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workersin the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of theirsignificance to the active areas or present day biochemical research...X588\t2\t821614\t2\t821614\t2\t821616\t2\t821635\t2\t821638\t2\t821638\t2\t821685\t2\t82148\t2\t821735\t2\t821748\t2\t821753\t2\t821756\t2\t821757\t2\t821775\t2\t821787\t2\t821792\t2\t821821\t2\t821821\t2\t821821\t2\t821821\t2\t821821\t2\t821831\t2\t821167\t2\t821189\t2\t821193\t2\t821195\t2\t821196\t2\t821198\t2\t821905\t2\t821952\t2\t821953\t2\t821201\t2\t821201\t2\t821219\t2\t8211083\t2\t8211210\t2\t8211254\t2\t8211256\t2\t8211260\t2\t8211275\t2\t8211275\t2\t8211275\t2\t8211278\t2\t8211290\t2\t8211302\t2\t8211302\t2\t8211302\t2\t8211352\t2\t8211355\t2\t8211355\t2\t8211369\t2\t8211369\t2\t8211373\t2\t8211397\t2\t8211418\t2\t821379\t2\t821",

The sample included data-baseproducers and self-contained systems that both create, and provide servicesfrom, a data base..From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations,and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed..Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly byfactors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff,than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods,or computer programming..The total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed toshow the overall pattern of cost distribution, including overheads...X419\t2\t822421\t2\t822440\t2\t822452\t2\t822453\t2\t822456\t2\t822458\t2\t822465\t2\t822466\t2\t822467\t2\t822468\t2\t822468\t2\t822468\t2\t822481\t2\t822490\t2\t822491\t2\t822491\t2\t822495\t2\t822494\t2\t822506\t2\t822506\t2\t822507\t2\t822507\t2\t822508\t2\t822510\t2\t822510\t2\t822511\t2\t822512\t2\t822512\t2\t822514\t2\t822514\t2\t822514\t2\t822514\t2\t822517\t2\t822518\t2\t822520\t2\t822520\t2\t822520\t2\t822521\t2\t822523\t2\t822523\t2\t822524\t2\t822526\t2\t822528\t2\t822529\t2\t822554\t2\t822575\t2\t822576\t2\t822579\t2\t822580\t2\t822582\t2\t822591\t2\t822591\t2\t822591\t2\t822595\t2\t822595\t2\t822595\t2\t822599\t2\t822603\t2\t822603\t2\t822603\t2\t822604\t2\t822604\t2\t822609\t2\t822612\t2\t822615\t2\t822615\t2\t822619\t2\t822619\t2\t822620\t2\t822621\t2\t822622\t2\t822622\t2\t822623\t2\t822623\t2\t822623\t2\t822625\t2\t822629\t2\t822629\t2\t822630\t2\t822630\t2\t822631\t2\t822632\t2\t822633\t2\t822633\t2\t822639\t2\t822639\t2\t822639\t2\t822646\t2\t822646\t2\t822647\t2\t822651\t2\t822659\t2\t822676\t2\t822699\t2\t82218\t2\t82218\t2\t82228\t2\t82234\t2\t82238\t2\t82249\t2\t822700\t2\t822705\t2\t822707\t2\t822711\t2\t822722\t2\t822723\t2\t822723\t2\t822726\t2\t822726\t2\t822726\t2\t822727\t2\t822728\t2\t822728\t2\t822729\t2\t822730\t2\t822730\t2\t822731\t2\t822731\t2\t822732\t2\t822752\t2\t822752\t2\t822754\t2\t822755\t2\t822765\t2\t82253\t2\t82259\t2\t822779\t2\t822780\t2\t822785\t2\t822809\t2\t822810\t2\t822812\t2\t822813\t2\t822813\t2\t822813\t2\t822814\t2\t822814\t2\t822817\t2\t822818\t2\t822820\t2\t822820\t2\t822820\t2\t822820\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822822\t2\t822823\t2\t822827\t2\t822827\t2\t822827\t2\t822828\t2\t822829\t2\t822854\t2\t822866\t2\t822870\t2\t822870\t2\t822871\t2\t822872\t2\t822873\t2\t822873\t2\t822874\t2\t822875\t2\t822876\t2\t822877\t2\t822878\t2\t822879\t2\t822879\t2\t822880\t2\t822892\t2\t822895\t2\t822125\t2\t822128\t2\t822129\t2\t822130\t2\t822141\t2\t822145\t2\t822157\t2\t822164\t2\t822164\t2\t822167\t2\t822172\t2\t822175\t2\t822178\t2\t822907\t2\t822907\t2\t822925\t2\t822940\t2\t822941\t2\t822943\t2\t822944\t2\t822990\t2\t822994\t2\t822997\t2\t822998\t2\t822202\t2\t822211\t2\t822213\t2\t822223\t2\t822224\t2\t822224\t2\t822225\t2\t822234\t2\t822243\t2\t822244\t2\t822280\t2\t822298\t2\t822299\t2\t8221070\t2\t8221078\t2\t8221079\t2\t8221085\t2\t8221089\t2\t8221091\t2\t8221091\t2\t8221091\t2\t8221091\t2\t8221143\t2\t8221143\t2\t8221230\t2\t8221257\t2\t8221264\t2\t8221282\t2\t8221283\t2\t8221298\t2\t8221299\t2\t8221302\t2\t8221303\t2\t8221303\t2\t8221363\t2\t8221366\t2\t8221366\t2\t8221367\t2\t8221367\t2\t8221368\t2\t8221368\t2\t8221374\t2\t8221390\t2\t8221396\t2\t8221396\t2\t8221396\t2\t8221401\t2\t8221435\t2\t8221436\t2\t8221437\t2\t8221448\t2\t822365\t2\t822374\t2\t822378\t2\t822381\t2\t822381\t2\t822381\t2\t822381\t2\t822389\t2\t822393\t2\t822",

This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are notfamiliar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance ofsome of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how amachine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derivedfrom a study of natural language, developed out of research intoprinciples for a new general classification.PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in somerespects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings.Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index,PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribedlist of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of anopen-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into theindex at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms arehandled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and thesemantic sides of the system..X422\t2\t825433\t2\t825448\t2\t825453\t2\t825458\t2\t825459\t2\t825478\t2\t825480\t2\t825480\t2\t825483\t2\t825484\t2\t825486\t2\t825487\t2\t825488\t2\t825491\t2\t825493\t2\t825503\t2\t825507\t2\t825509\t2\t825510\t2\t825512\t2\t825517\t2\t825520\t2\t825522\t2\t825527\t2\t825528\t2\t825530\t2\t825531\t2\t825534\t2\t825565\t2\t825566\t2\t825577\t2\t825581\t2\t825596\t2\t825603\t2\t825608\t2\t825608\t2\t825633\t2\t825641\t2\t825643\t2\t825644\t2\t825645\t2\t825649\t2\t825650\t2\t825652\t2\t825659\t2\t82510\t2\t825702\t2\t825709\t2\t825715\t2\t825731\t2\t825732\t2\t825746\t2\t825754\t2\t825755\t2\t82551\t2\t825781\t2\t825790\t2\t82569\t2\t82571\t2\t82577\t2\t82579\t2\t82579\t2\t82586\t2\t82592\t2\t825805\t2\t825809\t2\t825810\t2\t825812\t2\t825813\t2\t825814\t2\t825817\t2\t825817\t2\t825817\t2\t825817\t2\t825820\t2\t825823\t2\t825824\t2\t825824\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825825\t2\t825826\t2\t825827\t2\t825828\t2\t825830\t2\t825856\t2\t825880\t2\t825883\t2\t825886\t2\t825888\t2\t825894\t2\t825146\t2\t825160\t2\t825168\t2\t825168\t2\t825172\t2\t825175\t2\t825176\t2\t825190\t2\t825194\t2\t825901\t2\t825913\t2\t825930\t2\t825941\t2\t825943\t2\t825947\t2\t825948\t2\t825950\t2\t825963\t2\t825966\t2\t825978\t2\t825988\t2\t825997\t2\t825997\t2\t825225\t2\t825244\t2\t825246\t2\t825258\t2\t8251004\t2\t8251017\t2\t8251024\t2\t8251024\t2\t8251051\t2\t8251054\t2\t8251058\t2\t8251061\t2\t8251079\t2\t8251146\t2\t8251146\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251215\t2\t8251216\t2\t8251216\t2\t8251230\t2\t8251230\t2\t8251230\t2\t8251257\t2\t8251257\t2\t8251258\t2\t8251266\t2\t8251294\t2\t8251327\t2\t8251390\t2\t8251394\t2\t8251395\t2\t8251419\t2\t8251421\t2\t8251427\t2\t8251433\t2\t8251441\t2\t8251441\t2\t825304\t2\t825305\t2\t825306\t2\t825315\t2\t825358\t2\t825361\t2\t825365\t2\t825382\t2\t825382\t2\t825385\t2\t825394\t2\t825",

    "words": "While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it,certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit thefundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clashbetween OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only).Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne'swritings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARDDocumentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meetthese two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems,and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesisthat a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different froma 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this formfor some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recalland precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of therelevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But-Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only..X433\t2\t826450\t2\t826451\t2\t826452\t2\t826458\t2\t826459\t2\t826459\t2\t826459\t2\t826459\t2\t826459\t2\t826459\t2\t826459\t2\t826468\t2\t826484\t2\t826484\t2\t826492\t2\t826506\t2\t826508\t2\t826508\t2\t826511\t2\t826512\t2\t826514\t2\t826518\t2\t826520\t2\t826523\t2\t826523\t2\t826524\t2\t826524\t2\t826525\t2\t826525\t2\t826526\t2\t826526\t2\t826526\t2\t826527\t2\t826528\t2\t826529\t2\t826529\t2\t826530\t2\t826530\t2\t826532\t2\t826534\t2\t826534\t2\t826534\t2\t826534\t2\t826546\t2\t826546\t2\t826546\t2\t826553\t2\t826579\t2\t826579\t2\t826579\t2\t826594\t2\t826594\t2\t826603\t2\t826604\t2\t826606\t2\t826606\t2\t826606\t2\t826609\t2\t826610\t2\t826611\t2\t826612\t2\t826625\t2\t826625\t2\t826625\t2\t826626\t2\t826626\t2\t826626\t2\t826630\t2\t826633\t2\t826634\t2\t826635\t2\t826636\t2\t826636\t2\t826637\t2\t826637\t2\t826637\t2\t826642\t2\t826642\t2\t826646\t2\t826646\t2\t826646\t2\t826648\t2\t826650\t2\t826692\t2\t826696\t2\t826696\t2\t826699\t2\t82610\t2\t82618\t2\t826702\t2\t826702\t2\t826703\t2\t826703\t2\t826705\t2\t826705\t2\t826708\t2\t826726\t2\t826727\t2\t826728\t2\t826730\t2\t826731\t2\t826731\t2\t826732\t2\t826732\t2\t826732\t2\t826733\t2\t826733\t2\t826734\t2\t826734\t2\t826736\t2\t826736\t2\t826736\t2\t826738\t2\t826739\t2\t826740\t2\t826741\t2\t826742\t2\t826743\t2\t826744\t2\t826754\t2\t826755\t2\t826795\t2\t82661\t2\t826814\t2\t826817\t2\t826820\t2\t826820\t2\t826823\t2\t826825\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826826\t2\t826827\t2\t826827\t2\t826827\t2\t826827\t2\t826828\t2\t826830\t2\t826877\t2\t826879\t2\t826879\t2\t826879\t2\t826883\t2\t826883\t2\t826885\t2\t826120\t2\t826124\t2\t826127\t2\t826127\t2\t826129\t2\t826145\t2\t826190\t2\t826190\t2\t826190\t2\t826191\t2\t826197\t2\t826197\t2\t826947\t2\t826948\t2\t826211\t2\t826214\t2\t826218\t2\t826225\t2\t826243\t2\t826244\t2\t826274\t2\t8261004\t2\t8261017\t2\t8261035\t2\t8261035\t2\t8261058\t2\t8261078\t2\t8261089\t2\t8261091\t2\t8261146\t2\t8261207\t2\t8261230\t2\t8261257\t2\t8261263\t2\t8261264\t2\t8261297\t2\t8261303\t2\t8261356\t2\t8261356\t2\t8261357\t2\t8261364\t2\t8261368\t2\t8261368\t2\t8261370\t2\t8261370\t2\t8261370\t2\t8261372\t2\t8261372\t2\t8261372\t2\t8261373\t2\t8261374\t2\t8261374\t2\t8261374\t2\t8261375\t2\t8261375\t2\t8261376\t2\t8261376\t2\t8261377\t2\t8261377\t2\t8261383\t2\t8261390\t2\t8261396\t2\t8261405\t2\t8261427\t2\t826304\t2\t826305\t2\t826306\t2\t826307\t2\t826320\t2\t826330\t2\t826332\t2\t826357\t2\t826358\t2\t826376\t2\t826378\t2\t826382\t2\t826385\t2\t826394\t2\t826",

Comparisonsare made between the results for the two publications.  Some conclusions aredrawn on information seeking behaviour in the neuroscience community andon requirements for effective current awareness services in this field..X421\t2\t828433\t2\t828459\t2\t828465\t2\t828466\t2\t828490\t2\t828491\t2\t828506\t2\t828507\t2\t828510\t2\t828512\t2\t828534\t2\t828552\t2\t828591\t2\t828595\t2\t828603\t2\t828604\t2\t828622\t2\t828623\t2\t828629\t2\t828633\t2\t828639\t2\t828659\t2\t828676\t2\t82810\t2\t82818\t2\t82834\t2\t82849\t2\t828702\t2\t828711\t2\t828722\t2\t828723\t2\t828726\t2\t828728\t2\t828730\t2\t828731\t2\t828731\t2\t828732\t2\t828732\t2\t828735\t2\t828766\t2\t82853\t2\t82859\t2\t828784\t2\t82876\t2\t82889\t2\t828809\t2\t828810\t2\t828813\t2\t828814\t2\t828817\t2\t828820\t2\t828820\t2\t828822\t2\t828823\t2\t828825\t2\t828826\t2\t828827\t2\t828828\t2\t828828\t2\t828828\t2\t828828\t2\t828828\t2\t828828\t2\t828845\t2\t828870\t2\t828879\t2\t828164\t2\t828183\t2\t828184\t2\t828190\t2\t828193\t2\t828198\t2\t828947\t2\t828948\t2\t828201\t2\t828202\t2\t828204\t2\t828213\t2\t828224\t2\t828224\t2\t828225\t2\t828243\t2\t828244\t2\t8281017\t2\t8281055\t2\t8281058\t2\t8281091\t2\t8281146\t2\t8281230\t2\t8281257\t2\t8281283\t2\t8281298\t2\t8281299\t2\t8281363\t2\t8281366\t2\t8281367\t2\t8281368\t2\t8281372\t2\t8281374\t2\t8281390\t2\t8281396\t2\t8281397\t2\t8281432\t2\t828304\t2\t828305\t2\t828306\t2\t828358\t2\t828385\t2\t828394\t2\t828",

In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen muchfaster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), universitylibraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly highproportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures arenow forcing cancellation..

This leads to problems of:(a) currency: keeping the scheme in line with new discoveries..(b) hospitality: allowing room for insertion of new subjects..(c) cross-classification: a concept may be considered in such a way that itfits as logically into one discipline as another..Machine retrieval is also hampered by the fact that any individual concept isnotated differently, depending on where in the scheme it appears..The approach now considered is from an organized universe of concepts, everyconcept being set down only once in an appropriate vocabulary, where it acquiresthe notation which identifies it wherever it is used.. It has been found thatall the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though theybelong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes..In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected fromappropriate schedules.. Subjects are then built according to formal rules, thefinal class number incorporating operators which convey the fundamentalrelationships between concepts..Fron this viewpoint, the Rules and Operators of the proposed system can beseen as the grammar of an IR language, and the schedules of Entitles andAttributes as its vocabulary...X476\t2\t838477\t2\t838477\t2\t838477\t2\t838581\t2\t838653\t2\t838653\t2\t838666\t2\t83816\t2\t83830\t2\t838796\t2\t83871\t2\t83875\t2\t83875\t2\t83877\t2\t83878\t2\t83879\t2\t83880\t2\t83881\t2\t83882\t2\t83883\t2\t838802\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838838\t2\t838853\t2\t838898\t2\t838898\t2\t838154\t2\t838154\t2\t838154\t2\t838154\t2\t838159\t2\t838989\t2\t838212\t2\t838247\t2\t838257\t2\t838257\t2\t8381074\t2\t8381074\t2\t8381075\t2\t8381075\t2\t8381259\t2\t8381259\t2\t8381391\t2\t8381391\t2\t8381391\t2\t8381391\t2\t8381393\t2\t8381395\t2\t8381402\t2\t8381402\t2\t8381429\t2\t8381429\t2\t8381429\t2\t8381429\t2\t8381430\t2\t8381430\t2\t8381430\t2\t8381430\t2\t8381431\t2\t8381431\t2\t838",

This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles thatpresently exist which prevent the effective international interchange ofbibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for theIFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term\"content designators\"..If an international standard format can be derived, it would greatlyfacilitate the use in this country of machine-readable bibliographic recordsissued by other national agencies..

    "title": "An Experiment in Index Term Frequency",
    "author": "Svenonius, Elaine",
    "words": "This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factorin retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its \"breadth\" asit is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a givencollection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, whichfunction most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or thosewhich are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experimentand uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied bynonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated usingthe Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as theusual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine thestatistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the\"optimal\" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a fewdocuments are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are moreeffective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documentsare wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made forthe quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision neverimproves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. Acorollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the sameaverage breadth where one indexing consists ofsemantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and theother consists of merely \"reasonable\" index terms.. The result suggest thattitle-term indexing is qualifiedly superior...X416\t2\t894448\t2\t894448\t2\t894450\t2\t894466\t2\t894480\t2\t894483\t2\t894484\t2\t894486\t2\t894488\t2\t894491\t2\t894493\t2\t894503\t2\t894507\t2\t894509\t2\t894510\t2\t894511\t2\t894512\t2\t894514\t2\t894517\t2\t894520\t2\t894520\t2\t894521\t2\t894522\t2\t894527\t2\t894528\t2\t894531\t2\t894531\t2\t894565\t2\t894565\t2\t894565\t2\t894565\t2\t894566\t2\t894567\t2\t894570\t2\t894572\t2\t894576\t2\t894581\t2\t894586\t2\t894595\t2\t894596\t2\t894596\t2\t894603\t2\t894608\t2\t894608\t2\t894608\t2\t894619\t2\t894633\t2\t894636\t2\t894643\t2\t894659\t2\t894659\t2\t894659\t2\t89444\t2\t894715\t2\t894754\t2\t89451\t2\t89457\t2\t89457\t2\t894790\t2\t894791\t2\t89469\t2\t89471\t2\t89475\t2\t89477\t2\t89477\t2\t89479\t2\t89479\t2\t89486\t2\t894805\t2\t894809\t2\t894810\t2\t894810\t2\t894810\t2\t894810\t2\t894812\t2\t894812\t2\t894812\t2\t894813\t2\t894813\t2\t894814\t2\t894814\t2\t894814\t2\t894817\t2\t894817\t2\t894820\t2\t894824\t2\t894825\t2\t894870\t2\t894875\t2\t894894\t2\t894894\t2\t894894\t2\t894894\t2\t894894\t2\t894894\t2\t894168\t2\t894175\t2\t894175\t2\t894175\t2\t894176\t2\t894176\t2\t894928\t2\t894963\t2\t894990\t2\t894991\t2\t8941051\t2\t8941255\t2\t8941294\t2\t8941294\t2\t8941313\t2\t8941327\t2\t8941327\t2\t8941413\t2\t8941419\t2\t8941419\t2\t8941427\t2\t8941445\t2\t894315\t2\t894329\t2\t894329\t2\t894382\t2\t894382\t2\t894389\t2\t894390\t2\t894",

In thecourse of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, thepresence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are notvalid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore,using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials..Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished,that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship,including compilations and works produced under editorial direction..

If one ignored the majorhistorical resources in other languages (which few United States students read),notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau andothers (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it wasplain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamentalneeds.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's AHistory of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains inits second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continuesas announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is verylimited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore,the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis ofcrosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly thedevelopment of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has beento tie it all together.In the present offering, \"the West\" is used conventionally: Europeancivilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphereprogeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to \"cover\" even the West mayprove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet anunderstanding of those lands \"beyond\" would be most valuable to us all.Let us hope that someone will try to provide it..X8\t2\t90920\t2\t909171\t2\t909909\t2\t909909\t2\t909909\t2\t909909\t2\t909909\t2\t909909\t2\t909918\t2\t9091061\t2\t9091453\t2\t909",

Taking under consideration the study of\"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries\"prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts ofthe Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, withJack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting aninternational standard bibliographic description formonographic publications.  There was commonagreement that the objective was the development ofspecifications for the necessary data elements, theirorder of presentation, and the punctuation to delimitthem.  These specifications should be designed tosatisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and,with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable,the needs of the libraries of the entire world.

    "words": "As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferablealternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser foundthat the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938.  She reported 21articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog.  A quick check ofher list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles.She recorded nine opponents of the divided  catalog and six better knownmembers of the profession reserving judgement.  Lyle in his new edition of TheAdministration of the College Library considers it \"safer,\" rather than \"wiser\"as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at CentralMethodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown itscabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinionwas undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should beconsidered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because ofinconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filingof subject and title entries.  The following questions were asked of all usersof the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks:1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject?Were you looking under author, title, or subject?2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog?3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file?One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, werequestioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in aseparate catalog, 5 per  cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It mustbe admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced theway in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by theUniversity of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog..X565\t2\t928572\t2\t928595\t2\t928596\t2\t928608\t2\t928619\t2\t92857\t2\t92875\t2\t928810\t2\t928812\t2\t928813\t2\t928814\t2\t928870\t2\t928891\t2\t928894\t2\t928176\t2\t928928\t2\t928928\t2\t928928\t2\t928928\t2\t928928\t2\t928963\t2\t928963\t2\t928965\t2\t928973\t2\t928973\t2\t928973\t2\t928973\t2\t928990\t2\t928991\t2\t928202\t2\t928209\t2\t928209\t2\t928276\t2\t9281255\t2\t9281413\t2\t9281445\t2\t928326\t2\t928329\t2\t928",

The threats are cyclical and areassociated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notablyobscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations forthe libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both becausethe libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts werepreposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find thattiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, thelibrary appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce acritical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think theexperience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep mosturban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive.Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in therichest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economicsuccess.

    "words": "A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has alwaysbeen that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trainsfor current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately,the picture many faculty members have of what today'srequirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduatesare thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we faileven to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past andtrain people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of publiclibraries.   Library education, like the publiclibrary itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate ofoblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a positionof relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will witheraway, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is noshortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and forgraduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both.An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called \"Dust Gatherson the Public Library\" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline andloss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter isdead - while the public library lives on)..X22\t2\t934929\t2\t934934\t2\t934934\t2\t934934\t2\t934934\t2\t934934\t2\t934934\t2\t934954\t2\t934230\t2\t9341423\t2\t934",

The causes for being unaware of costsmay stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to theprofession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of costaccounting. What is suspected is a lack of the fewsimple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, inshort - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis.In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their relatedprocedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with successover the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents thefindings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements ofyour own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediaterequirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in thesix steps and five resource requirements which follow.

The total proportion of the budgets of large research librariesthat is spent for the processing of material, as distinguishedfrom the costs of its purchase or its directservicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come whennearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processingmaterial, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!.X415\t2\t952415\t2\t952505\t2\t952543\t2\t952560\t2\t952573\t2\t952614\t2\t952614\t2\t952618\t2\t952632\t2\t952635\t2\t952635\t2\t952638\t2\t952638\t2\t952667\t2\t95214\t2\t95219\t2\t95231\t2\t95236\t2\t95237\t2\t95237\t2\t95239\t2\t95240\t2\t95241\t2\t95247\t2\t95246\t2\t95248\t2\t952735\t2\t952748\t2\t952748\t2\t952748\t2\t952749\t2\t952751\t2\t952753\t2\t952756\t2\t952757\t2\t952760\t2\t952764\t2\t952765\t2\t952767\t2\t952767\t2\t952767\t2\t952772\t2\t952774\t2\t952775\t2\t952777\t2\t952778\t2\t952778\t2\t952782\t2\t952787\t2\t952792\t2\t95288\t2\t95296\t2\t95297\t2\t952804\t2\t952805\t2\t952821\t2\t952831\t2\t952891\t2\t952893\t2\t952102\t2\t952103\t2\t952132\t2\t952137\t2\t952167\t2\t952181\t2\t952182\t2\t952183\t2\t952184\t2\t952189\t2\t952193\t2\t952195\t2\t952198\t2\t952198\t2\t952905\t2\t952905\t2\t952951\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952952\t2\t952953\t2\t952953\t2\t952953\t2\t952953\t2\t952958\t2\t952964\t2\t952968\t2\t952201\t2\t952221\t2\t952233\t2\t952237\t2\t952253\t2\t952255\t2\t952269\t2\t952272\t2\t952297\t2\t952298\t2\t9521009\t2\t9521016\t2\t9521018\t2\t9521019\t2\t9521030\t2\t9521061\t2\t9521071\t2\t9521083\t2\t9521085\t2\t9521086\t2\t9521086\t2\t9521087\t2\t9521182\t2\t9521200\t2\t9521210\t2\t9521210\t2\t9521235\t2\t9521240\t2\t9521254\t2\t9521256\t2\t9521260\t2\t9521260\t2\t9521260\t2\t9521274\t2\t9521275\t2\t9521275\t2\t9521275\t2\t9521275\t2\t9521275\t2\t9521275\t2\t9521276\t2\t9521276\t2\t9521277\t2\t9521278\t2\t9521278\t2\t9521280\t2\t9521280\t2\t9521287\t2\t9521301\t2\t9521302\t2\t9521302\t2\t9521302\t2\t9521302\t2\t9521302\t2\t9521302\t2\t9521304\t2\t9521313\t2\t9521338\t2\t9521339\t2\t9521344\t2\t9521347\t2\t9521359\t2\t9521365\t2\t9521369\t2\t9521373\t2\t9521380\t2\t9521397\t2\t9521417\t2\t9521418\t2\t9521428\t2\t9521444\t2\t952313\t2\t952359\t2\t952359\t2\t952377\t2\t952379\t2\t952395\t2\t952395\t2\t952",

Librarians and their assistants respectresearch and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty inhelping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in mostinstances) of the usefulness of such research for theimprovement of their own organizations.Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision anddiscipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices;therefore, significant results can often be obtainedwith smaller samples and in shorter periodsof observation.

We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by morethan thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subjectof the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably somedivisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, thegreatest period of such activity started in 1937.

The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in theserials collections of industrial libraries because so much currenttechnical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals.These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study madeby one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journalshas potential for other libraries..X2\t2\t977475\t2\t977545\t2\t977552\t2\t977552\t2\t977587\t2\t977605\t2\t977613\t2\t977614\t2\t977614\t2\t977638\t2\t977638\t2\t97731\t2\t97733\t2\t97733\t2\t97736\t2\t97741\t2\t97746\t2\t977735\t2\t977747\t2\t977750\t2\t977753\t2\t977759\t2\t977760\t2\t977766\t2\t977767\t2\t977767\t2\t977767\t2\t977774\t2\t977775\t2\t977775\t2\t977782\t2\t977784\t2\t977788\t2\t977788\t2\t977789\t2\t977789\t2\t977793\t2\t97776\t2\t97789\t2\t97797\t2\t977800\t2\t977808\t2\t977889\t2\t977102\t2\t977111\t2\t977112\t2\t977132\t2\t977137\t2\t977139\t2\t977152\t2\t977155\t2\t977163\t2\t977183\t2\t977183\t2\t977183\t2\t977184\t2\t977193\t2\t977193\t2\t977195\t2\t977199\t2\t977905\t2\t977953\t2\t977977\t2\t977977\t2\t977977\t2\t977977\t2\t977977\t2\t977977\t2\t977977\t2\t977983\t2\t977983\t2\t977201\t2\t977201\t2\t977201\t2\t977203\t2\t977203\t2\t977203\t2\t977203\t2\t977204\t2\t977205\t2\t977210\t2\t977210\t2\t977225\t2\t977269\t2\t977269\t2\t9771016\t2\t9771023\t2\t9771030\t2\t9771030\t2\t9771055\t2\t9771055\t2\t9771056\t2\t9771087\t2\t9771090\t2\t9771135\t2\t9771203\t2\t9771203\t2\t9771256\t2\t9771260\t2\t9771275\t2\t9771276\t2\t9771278\t2\t9771280\t2\t9771285\t2\t9771286\t2\t9771287\t2\t9771302\t2\t9771335\t2\t9771352\t2\t9771352\t2\t9771352\t2\t9771369\t2\t9771390\t2\t9771397\t2\t9771397\t2\t9771417\t2\t9771428\t2\t9771432\t2\t9771451\t2\t9771451\t2\t977367\t2\t977373\t2\t977373\t2\t977373\t2\t977",

This overlap data was needed to predict the degree ofjoint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency ofcollective reclassification.The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections,showing, for example, that a random title from one library hada 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library.When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%.Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatestduplication elsewhere..X4\t2\t981458\t2\t981481\t2\t981483\t2\t981485\t2\t981580\t2\t981601\t2\t981622\t2\t981696\t2\t981705\t2\t981717\t2\t981728\t2\t981729\t2\t981770\t2\t981776\t2\t981779\t2\t981780\t2\t981781\t2\t981783\t2\t98161\t2\t98165\t2\t98167\t2\t98164\t2\t98170\t2\t98171\t2\t98172\t2\t98173\t2\t981834\t2\t981835\t2\t981848\t2\t981849\t2\t981850\t2\t981851\t2\t981851\t2\t981852\t2\t981862\t2\t981863\t2\t981872\t2\t981135\t2\t981162\t2\t981175\t2\t981175\t2\t981922\t2\t981925\t2\t981925\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981981\t2\t981982\t2\t981982\t2\t981984\t2\t981206\t2\t981207\t2\t981208\t2\t981245\t2\t981249\t2\t981249\t2\t981250\t2\t981271\t2\t981282\t2\t981290\t2\t981295\t2\t9811013\t2\t9811042\t2\t9811051\t2\t9811197\t2\t9811247\t2\t9811257\t2\t9811268\t2\t9811358\t2\t9811390\t2\t9811402\t2\t9811410\t2\t9811410\t2\t9811415\t2\t9811417\t2\t981374\t2\t981382\t2\t981394\t2\t981",

Over 50percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report,and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of personsclosely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARSsystem.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overallvalue cannot help but be colored by this connection..X408\t2\t986488\t2\t986489\t2\t986490\t2\t986491\t2\t986491\t2\t986492\t2\t986495\t2\t986496\t2\t986497\t2\t986493\t2\t986499\t2\t986494\t2\t986500\t2\t986506\t2\t986581\t2\t986583\t2\t986584\t2\t986586\t2\t986586\t2\t986591\t2\t986603\t2\t986608\t2\t986610\t2\t986659\t2\t986676\t2\t986696\t2\t98638\t2\t986763\t2\t986788\t2\t986795\t2\t98684\t2\t986801\t2\t986855\t2\t986119\t2\t986147\t2\t986916\t2\t986986\t2\t986986\t2\t986986\t2\t986986\t2\t986986\t2\t986986\t2\t986210\t2\t986213\t2\t986214\t2\t986214\t2\t986218\t2\t986241\t2\t986250\t2\t9861012\t2\t9861012\t2\t9861050\t2\t9861084\t2\t9861188\t2\t9861254\t2\t9861291\t2\t9861294\t2\t9861379\t2\t9861404\t2\t986340\t2\t986348\t2\t986355\t2\t986375\t2\t986381\t2\t986382\t2\t986",

Significant assessments will bemade on the participating organization in research parts not only forthe financing of day-to-day operations of facilities, especially set upfor their benefit, but also for the total enrichment of the universitylibrary resources..X415\t2\t1009431\t2\t100931\t2\t100936\t2\t100941\t2\t100946\t2\t1009760\t2\t1009767\t2\t1009774\t2\t1009778\t2\t1009891\t2\t1009181\t2\t1009182\t2\t1009183\t2\t1009184\t2\t1009193\t2\t1009195\t2\t1009198\t2\t1009905\t2\t1009939\t2\t1009942\t2\t1009952\t2\t1009953\t2\t1009955\t2\t1009964\t2\t1009968\t2\t1009201\t2\t1009269\t2\t10091009\t2\t10091009\t2\t10091009\t2\t10091009\t2\t10091009\t2\t10091018\t2\t10091019\t2\t10091240\t2\t10091354\t2\t10091359\t2\t10091390\t2\t10091397\t2\t10091417\t2\t10091424\t2\t1009340\t2\t1009395\t2\t1009",

Undoubtedly, many of the trends inrecent evaluation are due to the influence of Rothstein's article..X433\t2\t1017459\t2\t1017534\t2\t1017646\t2\t1017647\t2\t1017651\t2\t101710\t2\t1017702\t2\t1017731\t2\t1017732\t2\t1017817\t2\t1017820\t2\t1017823\t2\t1017825\t2\t1017826\t2\t1017827\t2\t1017828\t2\t1017190\t2\t1017910\t2\t1017927\t2\t1017942\t2\t1017943\t2\t1017944\t2\t1017947\t2\t1017948\t2\t1017948\t2\t1017225\t2\t1017234\t2\t1017244\t2\t1017248\t2\t1017274\t2\t1017274\t2\t10171008\t2\t10171008\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171017\t2\t10171049\t2\t10171049\t2\t10171049\t2\t10171058\t2\t10171145\t2\t10171146\t2\t10171206\t2\t10171230\t2\t10171237\t2\t10171257\t2\t10171263\t2\t10171357\t2\t10171357\t2\t10171378\t2\t10171390\t2\t10171440\t2\t10171450\t2\t10171453\t2\t1017304\t2\t1017304\t2\t1017305\t2\t1017306\t2\t1017306\t2\t1017338\t2\t1017358\t2\t1017385\t2\t1017394\t2\t1017",

    "words": "The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries,apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposedby the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, whichin university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was notconsidered to be of comparable importance with the major department --the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions wouldbe concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers orofficial documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largelyautonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staffwere mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and inanswering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections,especially on manuscripts or early printed books:  they rarely dealt with thegeneral bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-dayreference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to becomeexpert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any partin the activities of another.. Divisions between the variouskinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library'sorganization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that thisis a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach.Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freezethe administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject fieldoften undertook research in the subject outside the library and mightoccasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of hisfield, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connectionwith his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer,orientalist or linguist.The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a completere-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyondthe bounds of the old departments..X11\t2\t1020818\t2\t1020843\t2\t1020843\t2\t1020844\t2\t1020845\t2\t1020143\t2\t1020961\t2\t1020268\t2\t10201020\t2\t10201020\t2\t10201020\t2\t10201020\t2\t10201020\t2\t10201021\t2\t10201058\t2\t10201233\t2\t10201253\t2\t10201401\t2\t1020305\t2\t1020",

The ordinary way of doing this wouldbe either to talk popular science or to adopt one of the variousstyles in humanistic discussion of the reactions between menand science.

Althoughprofessionally my concern is with the history of science, I havea certain prehistoric past as a physicist, and this has ledme to treat these lectures in what is, perhaps, an extraordinaryway.My goal is not discussion of the content of science or evena humanistic analysis of its relations.  Rather, I want to clarifythese more usual approaches by treating separately all thescientific analyses that may be made of science.  Why shouldwe not turn the tools of science on science itself?

The amountof instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficienciesof the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined interms of the values of the objectives.\tThe amounts of instruction andmotivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing theamounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message.The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function ofthe amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount ofmotivation in the state.

This research indicatesthat these models do not meet with important practical requirements.  Forexample, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additiveindex, in order to generate a wide range of project scores.  The additiveindex is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index.The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitraryfashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the modelbuilders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations onresulting project scores.  Comparative analyses relating project rankingsproduced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitabilityindex and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance ofthe scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the developmentof the model.  Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions ofproject data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals orcategories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implicationsfor final project scores and associated rankings..X423\t2\t1039423\t2\t1039423\t2\t1039423\t2\t1039424\t2\t1039424\t2\t1039425\t2\t1039425\t2\t1039425\t2\t1039425\t2\t1039426\t2\t1039427\t2\t1039427\t2\t1039428\t2\t1039428\t2\t1039436\t2\t1039437\t2\t1039561\t2\t1039561\t2\t10391039\t2\t10391039\t2\t10391039\t2\t10391039\t2\t10391039\t2\t10391039\t2\t10391040\t2\t10391040\t2\t10391040\t2\t10391040\t2\t10391449\t2\t1039",

In some connections it may bedesirable to use a still broader definition of communication,namely, one which would include the procedures by means ofwhich one mechanism (say automatic equipment to track anairplane and to compute its probably future positions) affectsanother mechanism (say a guided missile chasing this airplane).The language of this memorandum will often appear to refer tothe special, but still very broad and important, field of thecommunication of speech; but practically everything said appliesequally as well to music of any sort, and to still or movingpictures, as in television..X444\t2\t1045445\t2\t1045447\t2\t1045449\t2\t1045456\t2\t1045457\t2\t1045459\t2\t1045469\t2\t1045474\t2\t1045486\t2\t1045532\t2\t1045572\t2\t1045574\t2\t1045585\t2\t1045590\t2\t1045599\t2\t1045625\t2\t1045640\t2\t1045652\t2\t1045660\t2\t1045665\t2\t1045665\t2\t1045665\t2\t104520\t2\t104529\t2\t104534\t2\t104535\t2\t104542\t2\t104542\t2\t104543\t2\t1045716\t2\t1045762\t2\t1045762\t2\t1045764\t2\t104553\t2\t104558\t2\t104560\t2\t104570\t2\t104584\t2\t104585\t2\t104585\t2\t104585\t2\t104595\t2\t1045803\t2\t1045893\t2\t1045129\t2\t1045137\t2\t1045168\t2\t1045172\t2\t1045175\t2\t1045175\t2\t10451016\t2\t10451022\t2\t10451030\t2\t10451030\t2\t10451037\t2\t10451037\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451045\t2\t10451046\t2\t10451047\t2\t10451054\t2\t10451077\t2\t10451084\t2\t10451116\t2\t10451161\t2\t10451195\t2\t10451201\t2\t10451201\t2\t10451204\t2\t10451213\t2\t10451220\t2\t10451235\t2\t10451268\t2\t10451281\t2\t10451285\t2\t10451296\t2\t10451327\t2\t10451327\t2\t10451389\t2\t10451422\t2\t10451443\t2\t1045312\t2\t1045355\t2\t1045382\t2\t1045",

This strategy is developed by devotingconsiderable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and,particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures ofsatisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set ofrequirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or twoelements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from anyprevious report in the area of job satisfaction.Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for bothacademicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as apowerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the natureand correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area havebeen plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuringdevices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a differentscale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened thedoor for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of thejigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, thepresent volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developedmeasuring instrument that will allow comparability of results acrossstudies.

    "words": "An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicatorsregarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuliused to represent documents in information retrieval systems.  In effect,since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated uponthe examination of one \"level of processing\" of the document (e.g., thecitation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the propertiesof what constitutes \"relevance\".  However, prior to such an analysis, aneven more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portionsof a document should be examined.An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs),functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predictthe relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documentsby motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlledexperimental conditions.  The hypothesis that there might be other intermediateresponse products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph,last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would berepresentative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation andabstract) was tested systematically.  The results showed that:1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatmentgroups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which matchthe subsequent user relevancy decision on the document;2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predictedrelevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs;3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was notsubstantive.Some of these results are quite different than would be expected from previouswork with unmotivated subjects..X420\t2\t1054451\t2\t1054480\t2\t1054571\t2\t1054578\t2\t1054582\t2\t1054589\t2\t1054594\t2\t1054595\t2\t1054655\t2\t1054656\t2\t1054657\t2\t1054657\t2\t105435\t2\t105435\t2\t105442\t2\t105443\t2\t1054712\t2\t105452\t2\t105458\t2\t1054781\t2\t1054785\t2\t105470\t2\t105473\t2\t105481\t2\t105486\t2\t105495\t2\t1054817\t2\t1054825\t2\t1054194\t2\t10541024\t2\t10541045\t2\t10541054\t2\t10541054\t2\t10541054\t2\t10541054\t2\t10541054\t2\t10541154\t2\t10541215\t2\t10541232\t2\t10541281\t2\t10541295\t2\t10541298\t2\t1054",

The survey was designated to discover the subject,date and language characteristics of the borrowed literature, the mostfrequently requested journals, and the most popular sources of referencesto biomedical publications.The loans were spread over 1,084 titles, although 9 per cent of the issuesinvolved only 2 per cent of the titles.  The literature in most demand wasless than one year old and in the case of medicine 50 per cent of the requestswere for literature lss than 3 1/2 years old.  The half-life for the biologicalliterature was somewhat longer at 5 3/4 years.  The majority of issues (87.8per cent) involved English language periodicals.Overall, the principal sources of references to the requested literaturewere citation lists in other periodical articles.  Regarding the more recentliterature, however, abstracting and indexing journals were the primarysources of information.  For medical references Index Medicus was the mostused indexing publication, and for biological references Current Contents..X2\t2\t1055475\t2\t1055495\t2\t1055526\t2\t1055545\t2\t1055552\t2\t1055552\t2\t1055552\t2\t1055587\t2\t1055605\t2\t1055613\t2\t1055614\t2\t1055638\t2\t1055676\t2\t105533\t2\t105536\t2\t105541\t2\t1055735\t2\t1055735\t2\t1055747\t2\t1055750\t2\t1055753\t2\t1055760\t2\t1055766\t2\t1055766\t2\t1055767\t2\t1055774\t2\t1055775\t2\t1055775\t2\t1055779\t2\t1055782\t2\t1055784\t2\t1055784\t2\t1055788\t2\t1055788\t2\t1055788\t2\t1055789\t2\t1055789\t2\t1055790\t2\t1055793\t2\t105565\t2\t105575\t2\t105576\t2\t105576\t2\t105576\t2\t105589\t2\t105589\t2\t105597\t2\t1055800\t2\t1055808\t2\t1055828\t2\t1055102\t2\t1055111\t2\t1055112\t2\t1055132\t2\t1055137\t2\t1055139\t2\t1055152\t2\t1055155\t2\t1055156\t2\t1055163\t2\t1055183\t2\t1055183\t2\t1055183\t2\t1055184\t2\t1055184\t2\t1055193\t2\t1055193\t2\t1055195\t2\t1055198\t2\t1055199\t2\t1055905\t2\t1055953\t2\t1055977\t2\t1055977\t2\t1055983\t2\t1055201\t2\t1055203\t2\t1055203\t2\t1055204\t2\t1055204\t2\t1055210\t2\t1055210\t2\t1055210\t2\t1055213\t2\t1055214\t2\t1055225\t2\t1055269\t2\t10551016\t2\t10551023\t2\t10551030\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551055\t2\t10551056\t2\t10551083\t2\t10551086\t2\t10551087\t2\t10551090\t2\t10551135\t2\t10551260\t2\t10551275\t2\t10551276\t2\t10551278\t2\t10551280\t2\t10551281\t2\t10551285\t2\t10551286\t2\t10551287\t2\t10551295\t2\t10551297\t2\t10551302\t2\t10551335\t2\t10551390\t2\t10551397\t2\t10551397\t2\t10551417\t2\t10551428\t2\t10551432\t2\t10551432\t2\t10551451\t2\t1055359\t2\t1055373\t2\t1055382\t2\t1055",

    "words": "This paper analyses the formation of a new discipline, molecular biology,from the development of phage work.  It argues that such social variablesas the competitive position and relative status of each of the specialities ordisciplines from which a new one is formed are not sufficient to explainphage work's development into the specialty of molecular biology.  Eventhough persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decidedto enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even thoughsome recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficientto account for the development of the specialty, particularly given thecompetitiveness of modern conditions.  In the emergence of molecularbiology from phage work, the variables of status and competitive position,adduced by Professors Ben-David and Collins to explain the emergenceof experimental psychology from the hybridization of physiology andphilosophy, seem to be less important than other normal activities whichoccur in scientific development..X544\t2\t1063544\t2\t1063560\t2\t1063605\t2\t1063667\t2\t106333\t2\t1063750\t2\t1063775\t2\t106395\t2\t106398\t2\t1063800\t2\t1063101\t2\t1063101\t2\t1063102\t2\t1063105\t2\t1063105\t2\t1063105\t2\t1063105\t2\t1063109\t2\t1063110\t2\t10631030\t2\t10631030\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631063\t2\t10631081\t2\t10631082\t2\t10631088\t2\t10631284\t2\t10631285\t2\t10631286\t2\t10631287\t2\t10631300\t2\t10631308\t2\t10631312\t2\t10631315\t2\t10631329\t2\t10631334\t2\t10631342\t2\t10631386\t2\t10631386\t2\t10631387\t2\t10631387\t2\t10631389\t2\t10631408\t2\t1063343\t2\t1063386\t2\t1063391\t2\t1063398\t2\t1063",

As iswell known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also,in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments,a coherent theory of library classification has been established in eachof its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and inthe alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible toconstruct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions(of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly)is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.  Moreover, theyare easier to construct..X476\t2\t1066477\t2\t1066516\t2\t1066154\t2\t1066257\t2\t1066258\t2\t1066260\t2\t1066263\t2\t10661066\t2\t10661066\t2\t10661066\t2\t10661066\t2\t10661066\t2\t10661231\t2\t10661231\t2\t10661231\t2\t10661255\t2\t10661259\t2\t10661391\t2\t10661393\t2\t10661393\t2\t10661394\t2\t10661414\t2\t10661429\t2\t10661430\t2\t1066388\t2\t1066",

Secondary attention will be given to development of programs which canbe undertaken with Government support for identifying,  analyzing, and givinga structure to the total flow of scientific and technical information in theUnited States.\".X459\t2\t1080481\t2\t1080850\t2\t1080872\t2\t1080119\t2\t1080123\t2\t1080175\t2\t1080925\t2\t1080939\t2\t1080940\t2\t1080941\t2\t1080996\t2\t1080206\t2\t1080273\t2\t10801011\t2\t10801011\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801080\t2\t10801144\t2\t10801198\t2\t10801258\t2\t10801435\t2\t10801436\t2\t10801441\t2\t1080331\t2\t1080336\t2\t1080361\t2\t1080376\t2\t1080",

    "words": "One of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrievalis that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary tointroduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population ofscientists.  It is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of thetransmission and development of ideas within a population.  Specifically, thetransmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were thetransmission of an infectious disease, that is, in terms of an epidemic process.An attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in thedevelopment of such a process..X416\t2\t1081544\t2\t1081560\t2\t1081587\t2\t1081605\t2\t1081667\t2\t1081667\t2\t1081667\t2\t1081667\t2\t108133\t2\t108136\t2\t108144\t2\t1081748\t2\t1081748\t2\t1081750\t2\t1081750\t2\t1081751\t2\t1081759\t2\t1081759\t2\t1081765\t2\t1081765\t2\t1081767\t2\t108157\t2\t108157\t2\t1081775\t2\t1081778\t2\t1081778\t2\t1081787\t2\t1081787\t2\t1081791\t2\t1081792\t2\t1081793\t2\t108176\t2\t108181\t2\t1081800\t2\t1081800\t2\t1081893\t2\t1081101\t2\t1081105\t2\t1081144\t2\t1081184\t2\t1081193\t2\t1081195\t2\t1081201\t2\t1081203\t2\t1081204\t2\t1081205\t2\t1081233\t2\t1081267\t2\t10811030\t2\t10811063\t2\t10811081\t2\t10811081\t2\t10811081\t2\t10811081\t2\t10811081\t2\t10811081\t2\t10811083\t2\t10811083\t2\t10811085\t2\t10811086\t2\t10811082\t2\t10811082\t2\t10811082\t2\t10811082\t2\t10811082\t2\t10811088\t2\t10811088\t2\t10811088\t2\t10811201\t2\t10811201\t2\t10811201\t2\t10811201\t2\t10811227\t2\t10811270\t2\t10811278\t2\t10811285\t2\t10811286\t2\t10811287\t2\t10811308\t2\t10811312\t2\t10811334\t2\t10811401\t2\t10811417\t2\t10811418\t2\t10811444\t2\t1081359\t2\t1081359\t2\t1081395\t2\t1081",

    "words": "One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure natureof its own growth.  Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, atone time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how theirparticular science has reached its present state and what will be the course ofits future development.  These questions seem to be of such importance toscientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in theirown right.Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spreadwithin a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and cantherefore be investigated as an epidemic process.  Consequently, a new set ofmathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature ofscientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible toestablish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given areaof scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing linesof investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within thegiven area.The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying itto the development of knowledge about mast cells.  In his recent comprehensivesurvey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a \"full bibliography\"in which \"every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.\"  This bibliographyconstitutes ideal data for the application of epidemic theory to the spread ofscientific ideas, since it provides us with  all the contributions to thesubject area, from Ehrlich's discovery of the mast cell in 1877 until 1963..X416\t2\t1082471\t2\t1082505\t2\t1082544\t2\t1082560\t2\t1082560\t2\t1082587\t2\t1082599\t2\t1082602\t2\t1082605\t2\t1082618\t2\t1082631\t2\t1082632\t2\t1082667\t2\t1082667\t2\t1082667\t2\t108233\t2\t108233\t2\t108236\t2\t108239\t2\t108244\t2\t108248\t2\t1082724\t2\t1082748\t2\t1082748\t2\t1082750\t2\t1082750\t2\t1082751\t2\t1082759\t2\t1082759\t2\t1082765\t2\t1082765\t2\t1082767\t2\t108257\t2\t108257\t2\t1082775\t2\t1082778\t2\t1082778\t2\t1082784\t2\t1082787\t2\t1082787\t2\t1082791\t2\t1082792\t2\t1082793\t2\t108276\t2\t108281\t2\t1082800\t2\t1082800\t2\t1082803\t2\t1082893\t2\t1082101\t2\t1082105\t2\t1082144\t2\t1082184\t2\t1082193\t2\t1082195\t2\t1082201\t2\t1082203\t2\t1082204\t2\t1082205\t2\t1082228\t2\t1082228\t2\t1082229\t2\t1082233\t2\t1082233\t2\t1082267\t2\t10821010\t2\t10821030\t2\t10821044\t2\t10821063\t2\t10821081\t2\t10821081\t2\t10821081\t2\t10821081\t2\t10821081\t2\t10821083\t2\t10821083\t2\t10821085\t2\t10821086\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821082\t2\t10821088\t2\t10821088\t2\t10821201\t2\t10821201\t2\t10821201\t2\t10821219\t2\t10821227\t2\t10821270\t2\t10821278\t2\t10821285\t2\t10821286\t2\t10821286\t2\t10821286\t2\t10821287\t2\t10821287\t2\t10821290\t2\t10821300\t2\t10821308\t2\t10821312\t2\t10821334\t2\t10821335\t2\t10821338\t2\t10821341\t2\t10821401\t2\t10821417\t2\t10821417\t2\t10821418\t2\t10821418\t2\t10821444\t2\t10821444\t2\t1082359\t2\t1082359\t2\t1082395\t2\t1082",

    "words": "Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematicalframework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold.  He iscareful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision,in case the value of the aging factor a or thecontents of the Bradford set change from year to year.  There is as yet verylittle experimental evidence on the consistencyof either.  Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factoris reasonably constant.  But the position ofthe Bradfod set is less satisfactory.  The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M.Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited inthe Journal of Ecology three or more times in1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles inthe two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear inboth.  Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year,only eight (25%) attained that level in both, andtwelve were cited less than three times in the other year.  The Kendall rankcorrelation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant.There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the dataanalyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are validparameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers.  There is nomention of the type of data to use.  The reader who sought guidance from theearlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in whichanalyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed interms of library use.  Krauze and Hillinger havediscussed the difference between citations in one article and future citationsto that article.  Their work implies a more complexrelation between a and u than Brookes suggests.  In any case, the validity ofcitations for forecasting library consultationsremains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is notnecessarily close.  For example, one item in a list of references is oftenintended to lead to a chain of earlier papers.  Again,each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most ofwhich he has consulted in a library.  In neither case is there anyinherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles betweenthe list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers..X505\t2\t1090515\t2\t1090545\t2\t1090550\t2\t1090552\t2\t1090573\t2\t1090587\t2\t1090605\t2\t1090613\t2\t1090614\t2\t1090614\t2\t1090614\t2\t1090616\t2\t1090638\t2\t109014\t2\t109033\t2\t109036\t2\t109041\t2\t109041\t2\t1090735\t2\t1090747\t2\t1090748\t2\t1090750\t2\t1090751\t2\t1090753\t2\t1090759\t2\t1090765\t2\t1090766\t2\t1090767\t2\t1090775\t2\t1090778\t2\t1090782\t2\t1090784\t2\t1090788\t2\t1090789\t2\t1090793\t2\t1090793\t2\t1090793\t2\t109089\t2\t109097\t2\t1090800\t2\t1090808\t2\t1090808\t2\t1090102\t2\t1090111\t2\t1090112\t2\t1090153\t2\t1090163\t2\t1090170\t2\t1090183\t2\t1090184\t2\t1090193\t2\t1090196\t2\t1090199\t2\t1090905\t2\t1090953\t2\t1090977\t2\t1090983\t2\t1090203\t2\t1090210\t2\t1090215\t2\t1090219\t2\t1090221\t2\t1090223\t2\t1090225\t2\t1090255\t2\t1090266\t2\t1090269\t2\t1090271\t2\t10901016\t2\t10901016\t2\t10901019\t2\t10901023\t2\t10901028\t2\t10901030\t2\t10901055\t2\t10901071\t2\t10901083\t2\t10901085\t2\t10901085\t2\t10901086\t2\t10901086\t2\t10901087\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901090\t2\t10901135\t2\t10901147\t2\t10901182\t2\t10901260\t2\t10901275\t2\t10901276\t2\t10901278\t2\t10901280\t2\t10901285\t2\t10901286\t2\t10901287\t2\t10901302\t2\t10901302\t2\t10901302\t2\t10901335\t2\t10901352\t2\t10901390\t2\t10901397\t2\t10901417\t2\t10901424\t2\t10901428\t2\t10901432\t2\t1090359\t2\t1090359\t2\t1090359\t2\t1090373\t2\t1090",

    "words": "Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear ScienceAbstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; weused the generalized file-management system, Master Control,which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode.The inverted mode uses a table composed of the uniquevocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along withall record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  Forexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have oneentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plusthe record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  Forexample, an inverted table constructed on titles will have oneentry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plusthe record numbers in which each word was found.  (In MasterControl, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded oneither side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma,colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode thedata element is compared with the profile word, character bycharacter, which results in a prohibitively time-consumingprocess for large data bases.We chose the inverted-table technique because of the largeamount of data to be searched.  Individual tables wereconstructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, andtitles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlledby the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA.We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions hadto be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of thequestions had actually been submitted by other members of thestaff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDIbasis.  The others were especially constructed by the authorsfor this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to beconsidered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained tothe subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered\"false drops,\" regardless of the number of words matchedbetween the profile and the citation..X421\t2\t1091440\t2\t1091450\t2\t1091451\t2\t1091452\t2\t1091452\t2\t1091453\t2\t1091459\t2\t1091465\t2\t1091466\t2\t1091467\t2\t1091468\t2\t1091468\t2\t1091468\t2\t1091484\t2\t1091490\t2\t1091491\t2\t1091492\t2\t1091495\t2\t1091506\t2\t1091506\t2\t1091507\t2\t1091508\t2\t1091508\t2\t1091510\t2\t1091510\t2\t1091511\t2\t1091511\t2\t1091512\t2\t1091512\t2\t1091512\t2\t1091514\t2\t1091514\t2\t1091514\t2\t1091514\t2\t1091517\t2\t1091518\t2\t1091518\t2\t1091519\t2\t1091520\t2\t1091520\t2\t1091520\t2\t1091521\t2\t1091523\t2\t1091523\t2\t1091524\t2\t1091524\t2\t1091525\t2\t1091526\t2\t1091526\t2\t1091528\t2\t1091529\t2\t1091530\t2\t1091534\t2\t1091546\t2\t1091553\t2\t1091576\t2\t1091579\t2\t1091580\t2\t1091582\t2\t1091587\t2\t1091591\t2\t1091594\t2\t1091595\t2\t1091595\t2\t1091603\t2\t1091603\t2\t1091603\t2\t1091603\t2\t1091604\t2\t1091604\t2\t1091604\t2\t1091606\t2\t1091609\t2\t1091609\t2\t1091610\t2\t1091611\t2\t1091612\t2\t1091612\t2\t1091615\t2\t1091619\t2\t1091622\t2\t1091622\t2\t1091623\t2\t1091623\t2\t1091625\t2\t1091626\t2\t1091629\t2\t1091629\t2\t1091630\t2\t1091631\t2\t1091632\t2\t1091633\t2\t1091633\t2\t1091636\t2\t1091637\t2\t1091639\t2\t1091642\t2\t1091646\t2\t1091648\t2\t1091650\t2\t1091659\t2\t1091676\t2\t1091692\t2\t1091696\t2\t1091699\t2\t1091699\t2\t109118\t2\t109118\t2\t109128\t2\t109134\t2\t109138\t2\t109149\t2\t1091700\t2\t1091703\t2\t1091705\t2\t1091705\t2\t1091707\t2\t1091708\t2\t1091711\t2\t1091722\t2\t1091723\t2\t1091723\t2\t1091726\t2\t1091726\t2\t1091726\t2\t1091726\t2\t1091727\t2\t1091727\t2\t1091728\t2\t1091728\t2\t1091728\t2\t1091729\t2\t1091730\t2\t1091730\t2\t1091731\t2\t1091731\t2\t1091731\t2\t1091732\t2\t1091732\t2\t1091733\t2\t1091734\t2\t1091736\t2\t1091738\t2\t1091739\t2\t1091740\t2\t1091741\t2\t1091742\t2\t1091743\t2\t1091744\t2\t1091752\t2\t1091754\t2\t1091755\t2\t1091755\t2\t1091764\t2\t109153\t2\t109159\t2\t1091780\t2\t1091785\t2\t109173\t2\t1091809\t2\t1091810\t2\t1091812\t2\t1091813\t2\t1091813\t2\t1091813\t2\t1091813\t2\t1091814\t2\t1091814\t2\t1091820\t2\t1091820\t2\t1091820\t2\t1091820\t2\t1091820\t2\t1091822\t2\t1091822\t2\t1091822\t2\t1091822\t2\t1091824\t2\t1091826\t2\t1091827\t2\t1091827\t2\t1091827\t2\t1091828\t2\t1091829\t2\t1091829\t2\t1091866\t2\t1091870\t2\t1091870\t2\t1091873\t2\t1091879\t2\t1091879\t2\t1091883\t2\t1091895\t2\t1091895\t2\t1091124\t2\t1091125\t2\t1091127\t2\t1091129\t2\t1091145\t2\t1091157\t2\t1091164\t2\t1091190\t2\t1091191\t2\t1091197\t2\t1091202\t2\t1091211\t2\t1091211\t2\t1091213\t2\t1091214\t2\t1091218\t2\t1091224\t2\t1091243\t2\t1091243\t2\t10911004\t2\t10911035\t2\t10911078\t2\t10911078\t2\t10911089\t2\t10911089\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911091\t2\t10911143\t2\t10911207\t2\t10911264\t2\t10911264\t2\t10911282\t2\t10911283\t2\t10911297\t2\t10911298\t2\t10911299\t2\t10911302\t2\t10911303\t2\t10911303\t2\t10911307\t2\t10911356\t2\t10911363\t2\t10911364\t2\t10911366\t2\t10911366\t2\t10911367\t2\t10911367\t2\t10911368\t2\t10911368\t2\t10911368\t2\t10911370\t2\t10911372\t2\t10911373\t2\t10911374\t2\t10911375\t2\t10911376\t2\t10911377\t2\t10911396\t2\t10911396\t2\t10911448\t2\t1091307\t2\t1091330\t2\t1091378\t2\t1091378\t2\t1091381\t2\t1091389\t2\t1091",

The size of thedictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords..The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and itscharacterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of thesearch pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are describedwhich are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects thatconstitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensedcontent.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrievallanguage comprises selection of words both from the title and the body ofthe document..Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination usingmathematical-statistic methods are given..Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have beencorroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses thereare the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a singleabstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in futurecharged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptorlanguage..

Itis concluded that indexes based on words extracted from textare practical for many purposes today, and that automaticassignment indexing and classification experiments show promisefor future progress..X419\t2\t1144420\t2\t1144455\t2\t1144479\t2\t1144483\t2\t1144485\t2\t1144498\t2\t1144501\t2\t1144503\t2\t1144562\t2\t1144564\t2\t1144565\t2\t1144576\t2\t1144583\t2\t1144586\t2\t1144589\t2\t1144589\t2\t1144603\t2\t1144608\t2\t1144643\t2\t1144657\t2\t1144660\t2\t1144661\t2\t1144662\t2\t1144663\t2\t1144664\t2\t114426\t2\t114438\t2\t114438\t2\t114439\t2\t1144722\t2\t1144769\t2\t114452\t2\t114477\t2\t114478\t2\t1144824\t2\t1144830\t2\t1144149\t2\t1144150\t2\t1144168\t2\t1144174\t2\t1144174\t2\t1144175\t2\t1144175\t2\t1144175\t2\t1144175\t2\t1144925\t2\t1144273\t2\t11441080\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441144\t2\t11441195\t2\t11441207\t2\t11441283\t2\t11441294\t2\t11441294\t2\t11441327\t2\t11441421\t2\t1144315\t2\t1144324\t2\t1144331\t2\t1144336\t2\t1144382\t2\t1144",

    "words": "In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluateand encourage continuing education programs incommunity hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute(PMI) has determined that there is need forguidance in the area of medical-library development.Reports from PMI physician consultants who visitedmore than 40 community hospitals indicate thatmedical-library facilities are generally poor andinfrequently used by physicians.  The basicweaknesses of these libraries fall into fourcategories: inadequate collections, inadequatepersonnel, inadequate space, and the absence ofany practical indexing system to facilitate use ofcollections that do exist.Failure to deal with these problems does notreflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulationto do so and absence of any concerted source ofguidance.  In response to requests for such guidancePMI has undertaken a community hospital librarydevelopment project in co-operation with theNew England Regional Medical Library Service(NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library ofMedicine.  This report is concerned with the firstphase of this project - namely, the formulation ofa list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks andjournals that can function as the core for a medicallibrary.Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sentto 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medicalpractice, including the basic sciences.  Thespecialists, chosen from regions throughout thecountry, were requested to recommend two textbooksand two journals in their area of special interestthat they considered to be the most basic andfundamentally useful for practitioners.

The rapid expansion of collections, both in sizeand scope, the great variety of forms taken by items that now must be housedin the library, and the growth in expectations among library users areamong the factors that have contributed to this complexity.  In this setting,managerial decision making in the library has become an unenviably difficulttask. Furthermore, the new technologies and new techniques which offer greatopportunities for library planners and  managers make even more difficult theuse of traditional, intuitive approaches.

The United States Steel Corporation is a formalorganization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New YorkState Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part ofa larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposeswe need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawnaround an organization or the exact distinction between an \"organization\" anda \"nonorganization.\"  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the worldhas an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into cleanclassifications.Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with whichthey are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged.We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However muchorganizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives andadministrators, and however many books for these practitioners havebeen written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificantplace in modern social science.  Most current psychology andsociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to thesubject of formal organizations.

Instead,every problem area has acquired a collection of procedures suited to itsspecial characteristics.  Of the many areas of interest, the pictorial domainhas received by far the most attention.

And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietlyexpressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changedutilization of existing manpower.It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, thenpresident of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committeeon Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignmentsand to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizingprofessional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a fewlibraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchersthat they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that aneed was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem couldbe more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois mighthave national implications, and that the resources for such a study should besought..X646\t2\t1206647\t2\t1206651\t2\t1206942\t2\t1206943\t2\t1206944\t2\t1206948\t2\t1206234\t2\t12061017\t2\t12061049\t2\t12061206\t2\t12061206\t2\t12061206\t2\t12061206\t2\t12061206\t2\t12061206\t2\t12061237\t2\t12061378\t2\t12061440\t2\t12061450\t2\t12061453\t2\t1206304\t2\t1206306\t2\t1206338\t2\t1206",

There must be some way to phrase the new ideas sothat they can contribute to and profit from the science of behaviorthat psychologists have created.  It was the search for that favorableintersection that directed the course of our year-long debate..X572\t2\t1213586\t2\t1213590\t2\t121366\t2\t121375\t2\t1213168\t2\t1213211\t2\t12131035\t2\t12131045\t2\t12131046\t2\t12131047\t2\t12131213\t2\t12131213\t2\t12131213\t2\t12131213\t2\t12131213\t2\t12131389\t2\t12131443\t2\t1213",

    "words": "In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new techniqueof chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chainprocedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneereda new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its firstissues of 1971.To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to considerthese indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handlingbibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Twoforces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subjectindexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers;secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchangenetworks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example.In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field ofsubject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to bedominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identifiedby the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabeticalfile.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good dealof Cutter's \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem ofidentifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presentingit as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion ofnatural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselectedcomponent would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer alsocreated a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headingswould be co-extensive with the subject of the document..X434\t2\t1215445\t2\t1215449\t2\t1215458\t2\t1215478\t2\t1215478\t2\t1215478\t2\t1215480\t2\t1215480\t2\t1215480\t2\t1215480\t2\t1215487\t2\t1215530\t2\t1215746\t2\t1215746\t2\t1215758\t2\t1215781\t2\t121586\t2\t1215817\t2\t1215817\t2\t1215819\t2\t1215824\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215825\t2\t1215874\t2\t1215880\t2\t1215146\t2\t1215160\t2\t1215168\t2\t1215168\t2\t1215194\t2\t1215901\t2\t1215258\t2\t1215259\t2\t12151024\t2\t12151024\t2\t12151024\t2\t12151024\t2\t12151024\t2\t12151027\t2\t12151054\t2\t12151061\t2\t12151146\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151215\t2\t12151230\t2\t12151230\t2\t12151231\t2\t12151255\t2\t12151265\t2\t12151441\t2\t12151443\t2\t12151448\t2\t1215",

There canbe no quarrel about the practical necessity for such alabor-saving, worry-reducing work, nor--abstractly--about itsvalue as a global standardizing agent, a means for achievingsome uniformity in an area that would otherwise be chaotic.Undoubtedly, it is a real boon to scholars, as well as toordinary readers, to find familiar, fairly constant headingsin subject catalogs as far removed geographically asWashington, DC and Lusaka, Zambia.  Knowledge and scholarshipare, after all, universal.  And a subject-scheme should, ideally,manage to encompass all the facets of what has been printed andsubsequently collected in libraries to the satisfaction of theworldwide reading community.  Should, that is.  But in the realmof headings that deal with people and cultures--in short, withhumanity--the LC list can only \"satisfy\" parochial, jingoisticEuropeans and North Americans, white-hued, at least nominallyChristian (and preferably Protestant) in faith, comfortablysituated in the middle and higher-income brackets, largelydomiciled in suburbia, fundamentally loyal to the EstablishedOrder, and heavily imbued with the transcendent, incomparable glory ofWestern civilization.  Further, it reflects a host of untenable--indeed,obsolete and arrogant--assumptions with respect to youngpeople and women.

The plan for the book originated with questions directedto a public library administrator and to a system director.  Themost pertinent of the repeated questions was, \"How does systemmembership change local library administration?\"  The sharpestquestion was, \"Will the system ultimately take over local rights andresponsibilities?\".X431\t2\t1236842\t2\t1236910\t2\t1236939\t2\t12361232\t2\t12361238\t2\t12361236\t2\t12361236\t2\t12361236\t2\t12361236\t2\t12361236\t2\t12361236\t2\t12361400\t2\t1236311\t2\t1236340\t2\t1236",

Seen thus, as a dynamic field fitfor the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing moreto its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creativecapacity, who have not before held this perspective of research..X616\t2\t1250789\t2\t1250795\t2\t12501242\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501250\t2\t12501403\t2\t12501422\t2\t12501428\t2\t1250",

While it has long been recognised that only a proportionof the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic librarybuildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness withremarkable speed.  In certain cases some new buildings are full evenbefore they have left the design-board stage.  It is difficult to avoidthe conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of longrange perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is nofeasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuousprogramme of \"selective book retirement\"'.  Library stock controlhas not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy,time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problemsof acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of servicesfor readers.  Early investigations of this issue have tended to betheoretical and Carol Seymour in her review \"Weeding the Collection\"put forward the view that \"a librarian should be able to begin his planfor weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary...He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have athand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden\".

    "words": "If the (major) premise is accepted, that fullyeffective machine-strategization of a retrieval systemdepends upon the use of a (hierarchically) structural(but highly flexible) notation as the equivalent forthe verbal access provided by either unitermic orarticulated conceptual indicators, a faceted classificationlogically emerges as the desideratum.The two aspects of a structural notation mostdeterminative here are hierarchicality and uniformuse of general categories (the latter, not merelyfor the sake of uniformity as such, but as the meansto a heightened flexibility).  These desiderata couldof course be present on the \"idea plane\" alone; butwithout their being present notationally they do notfurnish, to a mechanized retrieval system, the typeof assistance it requires for optimal functioning.The second (minor) premise ought to be that theUniversal Decimal Classification, being bothhierarchical and general-categoric, provides the desiredstructurality.  But the melancholy fact is that thisdesideratum is not always satisfied, for instancewhen UDC uses direct division of a hierarchy whendivision by general category would be equally appropriate..X476\t2\t1259476\t2\t1259477\t2\t1259477\t2\t1259477\t2\t1259477\t2\t1259516\t2\t1259542\t2\t1259653\t2\t1259653\t2\t1259758\t2\t1259838\t2\t1259838\t2\t1259898\t2\t1259258\t2\t1259259\t2\t1259263\t2\t12591066\t2\t12591231\t2\t12591231\t2\t12591259\t2\t12591259\t2\t12591259\t2\t12591259\t2\t12591259\t2\t12591259\t2\t12591391\t2\t12591391\t2\t12591391\t2\t12591391\t2\t12591414\t2\t12591429\t2\t12591429\t2\t12591430\t2\t12591430\t2\t1259388\t2\t1259",

Without pretending to exactness, we maydivide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-titleor bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the BostonMercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the BostonPublic (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, thecatalog now making by the Library of Congress.

Thepresent note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo'sassertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was astandard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first,challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as aKuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorismis in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons forthis..X1271\t2\t12721271\t2\t12721271\t2\t12721271\t2\t12721272\t2\t12721272\t2\t12721272\t2\t12721272\t2\t12721272\t2\t12721310\t2\t12721311\t2\t12721311\t2\t12721311\t2\t12721311\t2\t12721329\t2\t12721386\t2\t12721386\t2\t1272343\t2\t1272343\t2\t1272",

These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the majorbranches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interestedin identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future.Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to pushthese analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subjectdivision, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographicalproperties from the subject average.  One particularly important aspect ofsuch work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline.We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from astatistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify theappearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its firstappearance can such an area be identified?.X605\t2\t1273632\t2\t1273632\t2\t127333\t2\t127339\t2\t127348\t2\t1273784\t2\t127389\t2\t1273102\t2\t1273106\t2\t1273107\t2\t1273111\t2\t1273113\t2\t1273113\t2\t1273113\t2\t1273155\t2\t12731087\t2\t12731234\t2\t12731270\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731273\t2\t12731274\t2\t12731274\t2\t12731274\t2\t12731285\t2\t12731285\t2\t12731287\t2\t12731300\t2\t12731301\t2\t12731302\t2\t12731304\t2\t12731304\t2\t12731312\t2\t12731313\t2\t12731313\t2\t12731313\t2\t12731337\t2\t12731337\t2\t12731338\t2\t12731338\t2\t12731341\t2\t12731342\t2\t12731344\t2\t12731346\t2\t12731347\t2\t12731387\t2\t12731444\t2\t12731444\t2\t12731444\t2\t1273314\t2\t1273",

One of thebiggest of these is the problem of adequate libraryfacilities.It is the purpose of this paper to discuss thisproblem with special reference to the student whosecollege major is chemistry..X415\t2\t1275543\t2\t1275545\t2\t1275545\t2\t1275552\t2\t1275587\t2\t1275588\t2\t1275605\t2\t1275613\t2\t1275614\t2\t1275614\t2\t1275614\t2\t1275614\t2\t1275616\t2\t1275616\t2\t1275618\t2\t1275618\t2\t1275618\t2\t1275618\t2\t1275622\t2\t1275632\t2\t1275632\t2\t1275635\t2\t1275635\t2\t1275635\t2\t1275635\t2\t1275638\t2\t1275638\t2\t1275638\t2\t1275638\t2\t1275685\t2\t127514\t2\t127533\t2\t127533\t2\t127536\t2\t127536\t2\t127537\t2\t127537\t2\t127540\t2\t127541\t2\t127541\t2\t127548\t2\t1275735\t2\t1275735\t2\t1275735\t2\t1275735\t2\t1275747\t2\t1275748\t2\t1275748\t2\t1275750\t2\t1275753\t2\t1275753\t2\t1275756\t2\t1275757\t2\t1275759\t2\t1275766\t2\t1275767\t2\t1275767\t2\t1275767\t2\t1275772\t2\t1275775\t2\t1275775\t2\t1275775\t2\t1275775\t2\t1275776\t2\t1275777\t2\t1275782\t2\t1275784\t2\t1275784\t2\t1275787\t2\t1275788\t2\t1275788\t2\t1275789\t2\t1275789\t2\t1275789\t2\t1275792\t2\t1275793\t2\t127589\t2\t127589\t2\t127597\t2\t127597\t2\t127597\t2\t127597\t2\t1275800\t2\t1275808\t2\t1275821\t2\t1275821\t2\t1275821\t2\t1275831\t2\t1275891\t2\t1275102\t2\t1275111\t2\t1275111\t2\t1275112\t2\t1275132\t2\t1275137\t2\t1275163\t2\t1275167\t2\t1275183\t2\t1275184\t2\t1275185\t2\t1275189\t2\t1275193\t2\t1275193\t2\t1275195\t2\t1275195\t2\t1275196\t2\t1275196\t2\t1275198\t2\t1275198\t2\t1275198\t2\t1275198\t2\t1275198\t2\t1275199\t2\t1275199\t2\t1275905\t2\t1275905\t2\t1275905\t2\t1275905\t2\t1275933\t2\t1275952\t2\t1275952\t2\t1275952\t2\t1275952\t2\t1275952\t2\t1275952\t2\t1275953\t2\t1275953\t2\t1275953\t2\t1275977\t2\t1275983\t2\t1275201\t2\t1275201\t2\t1275203\t2\t1275203\t2\t1275210\t2\t1275211\t2\t1275217\t2\t1275219\t2\t1275220\t2\t1275221\t2\t1275225\t2\t1275233\t2\t1275237\t2\t1275253\t2\t1275255\t2\t1275269\t2\t1275272\t2\t12751016\t2\t12751023\t2\t12751030\t2\t12751030\t2\t12751030\t2\t12751055\t2\t12751071\t2\t12751071\t2\t12751076\t2\t12751083\t2\t12751086\t2\t12751087\t2\t12751087\t2\t12751090\t2\t12751135\t2\t12751147\t2\t12751210\t2\t12751210\t2\t12751254\t2\t12751256\t2\t12751260\t2\t12751260\t2\t12751260\t2\t12751260\t2\t12751260\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751275\t2\t12751276\t2\t12751276\t2\t12751276\t2\t12751276\t2\t12751278\t2\t12751278\t2\t12751280\t2\t12751280\t2\t12751283\t2\t12751285\t2\t12751285\t2\t12751286\t2\t12751287\t2\t12751290\t2\t12751301\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751302\t2\t12751335\t2\t12751355\t2\t12751355\t2\t12751369\t2\t12751369\t2\t12751373\t2\t12751380\t2\t12751380\t2\t12751390\t2\t12751397\t2\t12751397\t2\t12751397\t2\t12751417\t2\t12751418\t2\t12751428\t2\t12751432\t2\t12751432\t2\t12751432\t2\t12751451\t2\t1275359\t2\t1275361\t2\t1275361\t2\t1275373\t2\t1275379\t2\t1275379\t2\t1275",

    "words": "In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that caneliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data bymaking it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms ofearlier papers.  It is too much to expect a research worker to spend aninordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants ofantecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thoroughscholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if theycould be located quickly.  The citation index makes this check practicable.Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizingthe citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effortrequired to compile it.This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers anew approach to subject control of the literature of science.  By virtue ofits different construction, it tends to bring together material that wouldnever be collated by the usual subject indexing.  It is best described as anassociation-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leewayas he requires.  Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered byconventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subjectheading..X485\t2\t1277486\t2\t1277503\t2\t1277505\t2\t1277560\t2\t1277573\t2\t1277618\t2\t1277632\t2\t1277632\t2\t1277635\t2\t1277667\t2\t127719\t2\t127737\t2\t127739\t2\t127739\t2\t127740\t2\t127741\t2\t127747\t2\t127747\t2\t1277713\t2\t1277748\t2\t1277749\t2\t1277751\t2\t1277764\t2\t1277765\t2\t127750\t2\t1277777\t2\t1277778\t2\t1277782\t2\t127788\t2\t127797\t2\t1277804\t2\t1277805\t2\t1277893\t2\t1277102\t2\t1277103\t2\t1277175\t2\t1277952\t2\t1277233\t2\t1277253\t2\t12771010\t2\t12771016\t2\t12771061\t2\t12771085\t2\t12771086\t2\t12771087\t2\t12771182\t2\t12771200\t2\t12771234\t2\t12771274\t2\t12771274\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771277\t2\t12771278\t2\t12771280\t2\t12771280\t2\t12771283\t2\t12771285\t2\t12771285\t2\t12771285\t2\t12771287\t2\t12771287\t2\t12771287\t2\t12771301\t2\t12771302\t2\t12771302\t2\t12771304\t2\t12771313\t2\t12771313\t2\t12771338\t2\t12771344\t2\t12771347\t2\t12771347\t2\t12771380\t2\t12771428\t2\t12771444\t2\t1277313\t2\t1277359\t2\t1277377\t2\t1277377\t2\t1277377\t2\t1277379\t2\t1277395\t2\t1277",

    "words": "Since 1868 the number of mathematical publications per year(measured by counts of titles abstracted) has grown from about 800to 13,000 at an average continuous compound rate of about 2.5 percentper year, doubling about four times a century.  Deviations from theexponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.  If thetotal number of publications prior to 1868 is estimated by extrapolating fromthe curve of annual output, the cumulative grand total of mathematical titlesgrows from 41,000 in 1867 to 419,000 by the end of 1965.  Deviations froman exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two\"pauses\" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallelto the theoretical curve.  The well-known hypothesis of exponentialgrowth of the scientific literature is strongly confirmed but at a rate lessthan half that found by Price and other investigators.\tThe discrepancy appearsto be due to the failure of previous studies to take into account thetitles published before the beginnings of the time series used..X544\t2\t1286545\t2\t1286552\t2\t1286560\t2\t1286587\t2\t1286605\t2\t1286605\t2\t1286613\t2\t1286614\t2\t1286631\t2\t1286638\t2\t1286667\t2\t128633\t2\t128633\t2\t128633\t2\t128633\t2\t128636\t2\t128641\t2\t128648\t2\t128648\t2\t1286735\t2\t1286747\t2\t1286750\t2\t1286750\t2\t1286753\t2\t1286766\t2\t1286767\t2\t1286775\t2\t1286775\t2\t1286782\t2\t1286784\t2\t1286784\t2\t1286788\t2\t1286789\t2\t1286793\t2\t128661\t2\t128689\t2\t128697\t2\t1286800\t2\t1286800\t2\t1286808\t2\t1286101\t2\t1286102\t2\t1286104\t2\t1286105\t2\t1286106\t2\t1286111\t2\t1286112\t2\t1286163\t2\t1286183\t2\t1286184\t2\t1286193\t2\t1286199\t2\t1286905\t2\t1286907\t2\t1286953\t2\t1286977\t2\t1286983\t2\t1286203\t2\t1286210\t2\t1286225\t2\t1286233\t2\t1286269\t2\t12861016\t2\t12861023\t2\t12861030\t2\t12861055\t2\t12861063\t2\t12861081\t2\t12861087\t2\t12861082\t2\t12861082\t2\t12861082\t2\t12861088\t2\t12861090\t2\t12861135\t2\t12861142\t2\t12861255\t2\t12861260\t2\t12861268\t2\t12861275\t2\t12861276\t2\t12861278\t2\t12861280\t2\t12861285\t2\t12861285\t2\t12861285\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861286\t2\t12861287\t2\t12861287\t2\t12861287\t2\t12861287\t2\t12861302\t2\t12861308\t2\t12861312\t2\t12861334\t2\t12861335\t2\t12861335\t2\t12861338\t2\t12861341\t2\t12861346\t2\t12861380\t2\t12861390\t2\t12861397\t2\t12861417\t2\t12861428\t2\t12861432\t2\t1286373\t2\t1286",

This new theory was initially the result of a verypractical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is itpossible to define the quantity of information contained in a message ortelegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of informationcommunicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare thesetwo qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of theseproblems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunicationengineer and can now be discussed quantitatively.From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematicaland practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations.Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientificdiscussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and toshow a very direct connection between information and entropy.  Thethermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certainphysical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory,it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principlestates that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger thanthe amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negativeentropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  Thegeneralized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle ofinformation.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experimentsand is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics..X3\t2\t1309416\t2\t1309457\t2\t1309558\t2\t1309585\t2\t1309592\t2\t1309593\t2\t1309595\t2\t1309665\t2\t1309761\t2\t130960\t2\t130985\t2\t1309803\t2\t1309803\t2\t1309149\t2\t1309175\t2\t1309911\t2\t1309258\t2\t13091022\t2\t13091053\t2\t13091077\t2\t13091218\t2\t13091309\t2\t13091309\t2\t13091309\t2\t13091309\t2\t13091309\t2\t13091309\t2\t13091309\t2\t1309324\t2\t1309346\t2\t1309361\t2\t1309388\t2\t1309",

    "words": "We were introduced by Kuhn to the notion of scientific progress as a seriesof qualitative changes, each involving the overthrow of a prevailing paradigmof thought by a new paradigm which alters the whole perspective of a science.Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis.  It seems, if we judgeby constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises andrevolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novelself-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature ofcumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least amongpsychologists.  This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one ofpsychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: JeanPiaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that heis hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades beendeveloping a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of thedevelopment of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhnacknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits asequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking..X1271\t2\t13111271\t2\t13111271\t2\t13111271\t2\t13111271\t2\t13111272\t2\t13111272\t2\t13111272\t2\t13111272\t2\t13111310\t2\t13111311\t2\t13111311\t2\t13111311\t2\t13111311\t2\t13111311\t2\t13111311\t2\t13111329\t2\t13111386\t2\t13111386\t2\t13111386\t2\t13111387\t2\t1311343\t2\t1311343\t2\t1311",

Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third,I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach isseriously misleading.

It used to be believed thatthe results of scientific investigation would lead to continuousprogressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War andthen the economic crisis have shown that science can be used aseasily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have beenraised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the onlymeans of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves,faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectivelyfor the first time, how the work they are doing is connected withthe social and economic developments which are occurring aroundthem.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; toinvestigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, areresponsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possiblesteps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to adestructive utilization of science..X37\t2\t1330771\t2\t133063\t2\t1330965\t2\t13301030\t2\t13301099\t2\t13301158\t2\t13301330\t2\t13301330\t2\t13301330\t2\t13301330\t2\t13301330\t2\t13301330\t2\t13301330\t2\t1330",

Who published what and where therefore becomes a centralquestion in the understanding of scholarly, and in particularscientific, disciplines.  There have recently been a number ofinvestigations concerning the career of such publications.  Thiscareer, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages.1) Pre-publication.  Here the scholar writes the article, circulatesit to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informalmeetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971).2) Publication.  Here the article is submitted to one or more journalsfor publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971).3) Post-publication.  Here colleagues either ignore the publishedarticle or reward it through citations to it in their own work.  Thepractice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in whichscholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline..X545\t2\t1335545\t2\t1335552\t2\t1335587\t2\t1335605\t2\t1335613\t2\t1335614\t2\t1335638\t2\t133533\t2\t133533\t2\t133536\t2\t133541\t2\t133548\t2\t1335735\t2\t1335747\t2\t1335750\t2\t1335753\t2\t1335764\t2\t1335766\t2\t1335767\t2\t1335775\t2\t1335782\t2\t1335784\t2\t1335784\t2\t1335788\t2\t1335789\t2\t1335793\t2\t1335793\t2\t133588\t2\t133588\t2\t133589\t2\t133597\t2\t1335800\t2\t1335808\t2\t1335102\t2\t1335103\t2\t1335111\t2\t1335111\t2\t1335111\t2\t1335111\t2\t1335111\t2\t1335112\t2\t1335112\t2\t1335113\t2\t1335113\t2\t1335163\t2\t1335183\t2\t1335184\t2\t1335193\t2\t1335199\t2\t1335905\t2\t1335953\t2\t1335977\t2\t1335983\t2\t1335203\t2\t1335210\t2\t1335225\t2\t1335233\t2\t1335269\t2\t13351016\t2\t13351023\t2\t13351030\t2\t13351055\t2\t13351062\t2\t13351087\t2\t13351082\t2\t13351090\t2\t13351135\t2\t13351260\t2\t13351275\t2\t13351276\t2\t13351278\t2\t13351280\t2\t13351285\t2\t13351286\t2\t13351286\t2\t13351287\t2\t13351287\t2\t13351302\t2\t13351302\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351335\t2\t13351338\t2\t13351341\t2\t13351390\t2\t13351397\t2\t13351417\t2\t13351428\t2\t13351432\t2\t1335373\t2\t1335",

Social scientists are trying todetermine the extent to which so-called \"irrelevant\" characteristicsinfluence the ways in which people are judged by social institutionsand eventually reach social positions in the hierarchies of income,prestige, and influence.  Of the major institutions in American society,science has received perhaps the least systematic attention.  Littleis known about how scientists achieve positions of renown.  This bookexamines several aspects of a single basic question:  is the stratificationof individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance,or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment?A more technical way of putting the same question would be to ask whetheruniversalistic and rational criteria predominate as the basis forrecognition in the social system of science..X545\t2\t1337592\t2\t1337632\t2\t133748\t2\t133748\t2\t1337747\t2\t1337777\t2\t133755\t2\t1337791\t2\t133799\t2\t1337893\t2\t1337100\t2\t1337102\t2\t1337102\t2\t1337106\t2\t1337108\t2\t1337108\t2\t1337113\t2\t1337113\t2\t1337170\t2\t13371085\t2\t13371087\t2\t13371200\t2\t13371270\t2\t13371273\t2\t13371273\t2\t13371274\t2\t13371285\t2\t13371285\t2\t13371285\t2\t13371287\t2\t13371291\t2\t13371301\t2\t13371301\t2\t13371304\t2\t13371304\t2\t13371313\t2\t13371320\t2\t13371337\t2\t13371337\t2\t13371337\t2\t13371337\t2\t13371337\t2\t13371337\t2\t13371338\t2\t13371338\t2\t13371338\t2\t13371344\t2\t13371347\t2\t13371386\t2\t13371387\t2\t13371444\t2\t1337314\t2\t1337",

I hope, further,that the approach used - even if not the specific conclusions Ihave drawn from it - may be useful in bridging the gap that seemsnow to exist between those sociologists who are concerned withsociety as an entity and who analyze social behavior in terms ofits consequences for society as a whole and those sociologists whoare concerned first of all with the motives, attitudes, and goalsof the individual participants in these patterns of social behavior.My approach hopes to answer the question of why it is that mostindividuals, most of the time, come to \"want\" to do what it isthat society \"needs\" them to do.

Those historians and philosophers of science who express thispoint of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integralpart of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop apyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists..An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsiblefor advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most ofthe eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and NationalAcademy members of today, are the \"pedestrians\" of history..This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for thefield of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed:  one is drawnfrom a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second froma subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a thirdfrom a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of dataindicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published byvarious types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that thephysicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on theresearch produced by a relatively small number of scientists..

The Library employsa variety of mechanized techniques tofacilitate the storage, retrieval anddissemination of information.  During the past threeyears it has operated an SDI service using CTand ISI tapes.

A fourth type, the indexing andabstracting journal is defined but not relatedto the other three types.  The three currentawareness publications are shown to have arelationship in terms of the number ofrequests they can produce from a given set ofreferences or notices.  The SDI system willproduce about one request from ten notices;the intermediate type about one request perhundred notices; ad the unselected type,one request per thousand notices.  Despitethe differences in the number of notices togenerate one request, the cost to produce onerequest is about the same for the three typesof tools.

Over 97% of thesurvey respondees indicated that the services had contributed to theirprofessional activities.

Comparison shoppingbetween centers is advised as centers differ considerablyin the services which are offered,  the data bases which are available, theexperience of the information specialists who construct search profiles,pricing structures which are used, and the prices which are charged.Implications of the growing trend toward licensing and leasing informationresources, especially magnetic tape services, are discussed briefly..X400\t2\t1368421\t2\t1368440\t2\t1368448\t2\t1368450\t2\t1368451\t2\t1368452\t2\t1368452\t2\t1368452\t2\t1368452\t2\t1368453\t2\t1368459\t2\t1368459\t2\t1368459\t2\t1368465\t2\t1368466\t2\t1368467\t2\t1368468\t2\t1368468\t2\t1368484\t2\t1368484\t2\t1368490\t2\t1368491\t2\t1368492\t2\t1368495\t2\t1368493\t2\t1368506\t2\t1368506\t2\t1368507\t2\t1368508\t2\t1368508\t2\t1368510\t2\t1368511\t2\t1368511\t2\t1368511\t2\t1368512\t2\t1368512\t2\t1368512\t2\t1368514\t2\t1368514\t2\t1368516\t2\t1368517\t2\t1368518\t2\t1368518\t2\t1368520\t2\t1368520\t2\t1368521\t2\t1368521\t2\t1368522\t2\t1368523\t2\t1368523\t2\t1368523\t2\t1368524\t2\t1368524\t2\t1368525\t2\t1368526\t2\t1368526\t2\t1368526\t2\t1368527\t2\t1368528\t2\t1368528\t2\t1368529\t2\t1368529\t2\t1368530\t2\t1368534\t2\t1368546\t2\t1368546\t2\t1368548\t2\t1368553\t2\t1368575\t2\t1368576\t2\t1368579\t2\t1368580\t2\t1368591\t2\t1368594\t2\t1368594\t2\t1368595\t2\t1368603\t2\t1368603\t2\t1368604\t2\t1368604\t2\t1368604\t2\t1368606\t2\t1368609\t2\t1368609\t2\t1368610\t2\t1368610\t2\t1368611\t2\t1368612\t2\t1368612\t2\t1368612\t2\t1368615\t2\t1368619\t2\t1368622\t2\t1368622\t2\t1368623\t2\t1368623\t2\t1368625\t2\t1368625\t2\t1368626\t2\t1368626\t2\t1368627\t2\t1368629\t2\t1368629\t2\t1368630\t2\t1368631\t2\t1368632\t2\t1368633\t2\t1368633\t2\t1368636\t2\t1368636\t2\t1368637\t2\t1368639\t2\t1368642\t2\t1368646\t2\t1368648\t2\t1368650\t2\t1368659\t2\t1368676\t2\t1368692\t2\t1368696\t2\t1368699\t2\t1368699\t2\t136818\t2\t136818\t2\t136834\t2\t136849\t2\t1368700\t2\t1368700\t2\t1368703\t2\t1368705\t2\t1368705\t2\t1368705\t2\t1368707\t2\t1368707\t2\t1368708\t2\t1368711\t2\t1368722\t2\t1368723\t2\t1368723\t2\t1368726\t2\t1368726\t2\t1368726\t2\t1368727\t2\t1368727\t2\t1368727\t2\t1368728\t2\t1368728\t2\t1368728\t2\t1368729\t2\t1368730\t2\t1368730\t2\t1368731\t2\t1368731\t2\t1368731\t2\t1368732\t2\t1368732\t2\t1368733\t2\t1368734\t2\t1368736\t2\t1368738\t2\t1368739\t2\t1368740\t2\t1368741\t2\t1368742\t2\t1368743\t2\t1368744\t2\t1368754\t2\t1368754\t2\t1368755\t2\t136853\t2\t136859\t2\t1368809\t2\t1368810\t2\t1368812\t2\t1368812\t2\t1368813\t2\t1368813\t2\t1368814\t2\t1368814\t2\t1368817\t2\t1368820\t2\t1368820\t2\t1368820\t2\t1368822\t2\t1368822\t2\t1368824\t2\t1368826\t2\t1368826\t2\t1368827\t2\t1368828\t2\t1368866\t2\t1368870\t2\t1368870\t2\t1368873\t2\t1368875\t2\t1368879\t2\t1368879\t2\t1368879\t2\t1368883\t2\t1368883\t2\t1368885\t2\t1368114\t2\t1368124\t2\t1368124\t2\t1368125\t2\t1368125\t2\t1368125\t2\t1368127\t2\t1368129\t2\t1368145\t2\t1368145\t2\t1368164\t2\t1368165\t2\t1368169\t2\t1368190\t2\t1368191\t2\t1368197\t2\t1368990\t2\t1368202\t2\t1368211\t2\t1368211\t2\t1368211\t2\t1368213\t2\t1368214\t2\t1368218\t2\t1368224\t2\t1368243\t2\t1368243\t2\t1368289\t2\t13681004\t2\t13681035\t2\t13681051\t2\t13681073\t2\t13681078\t2\t13681078\t2\t13681089\t2\t13681089\t2\t13681091\t2\t13681091\t2\t13681091\t2\t13681143\t2\t13681207\t2\t13681264\t2\t13681264\t2\t13681283\t2\t13681297\t2\t13681298\t2\t13681299\t2\t13681302\t2\t13681303\t2\t13681303\t2\t13681303\t2\t13681303\t2\t13681327\t2\t13681356\t2\t13681356\t2\t13681363\t2\t13681364\t2\t13681364\t2\t13681366\t2\t13681366\t2\t13681366\t2\t13681366\t2\t13681367\t2\t13681367\t2\t13681367\t2\t13681367\t2\t13681367\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681368\t2\t13681370\t2\t13681370\t2\t13681372\t2\t13681372\t2\t13681373\t2\t13681374\t2\t13681374\t2\t13681375\t2\t13681375\t2\t13681376\t2\t13681376\t2\t13681377\t2\t13681377\t2\t13681392\t2\t13681396\t2\t13681396\t2\t13681414\t2\t13681448\t2\t1368307\t2\t1368330\t2\t1368345\t2\t1368378\t2\t1368378\t2\t1368381\t2\t1368382\t2\t1368",

Gibson Library's journal collection was conductedto determine 1) which journal titles could be discontinued, 2) which journalholdings could be moved to remote storage, and 3) which journal holdingscould be converted to microfilm.  Totals were maintained for three areas ofjournal usage according to: 1) the number of times patrons used currentissues, 2) the number of times the journal issues were reshelved by librarystaff, and 3) the number of times that journals were cited in articles byApplied Physics Laboratory (APL) authors.  The survey resulted in a 9.6%reduction in journal subscriptions which, in effect, added 7.5% additionalshelf space in which to display journals.  Further studies of theaccumulated data are being made to determine which holdings will be sent toa remote storage area which is under construction.

Lacking qualified persons to do literature searches,either in the library or in the research groups, greater use should be made ofthe available computerized searches..X450\t2\t1372451\t2\t1372452\t2\t1372459\t2\t1372459\t2\t1372459\t2\t1372468\t2\t1372468\t2\t1372484\t2\t1372492\t2\t1372508\t2\t1372508\t2\t1372511\t2\t1372512\t2\t1372514\t2\t1372518\t2\t1372520\t2\t1372523\t2\t1372523\t2\t1372524\t2\t1372524\t2\t1372525\t2\t1372525\t2\t1372526\t2\t1372527\t2\t1372529\t2\t1372529\t2\t1372530\t2\t1372530\t2\t1372534\t2\t1372534\t2\t1372546\t2\t1372547\t2\t1372553\t2\t1372579\t2\t1372594\t2\t1372603\t2\t1372604\t2\t1372606\t2\t1372609\t2\t1372610\t2\t1372611\t2\t1372612\t2\t1372625\t2\t1372626\t2\t1372630\t2\t1372633\t2\t1372635\t2\t1372636\t2\t1372636\t2\t1372637\t2\t1372637\t2\t1372642\t2\t1372642\t2\t1372646\t2\t1372648\t2\t1372650\t2\t1372692\t2\t1372696\t2\t1372699\t2\t137218\t2\t1372702\t2\t1372703\t2\t1372703\t2\t1372705\t2\t1372708\t2\t1372726\t2\t1372727\t2\t1372728\t2\t1372730\t2\t1372731\t2\t1372732\t2\t1372732\t2\t1372733\t2\t1372733\t2\t1372734\t2\t1372734\t2\t1372736\t2\t1372736\t2\t1372738\t2\t1372739\t2\t1372740\t2\t1372741\t2\t1372742\t2\t1372743\t2\t1372744\t2\t1372755\t2\t1372820\t2\t1372826\t2\t1372826\t2\t1372826\t2\t1372827\t2\t1372827\t2\t1372828\t2\t1372845\t2\t1372877\t2\t1372879\t2\t1372879\t2\t1372879\t2\t1372883\t2\t1372883\t2\t1372885\t2\t1372124\t2\t1372127\t2\t1372127\t2\t1372129\t2\t1372145\t2\t1372190\t2\t1372191\t2\t1372197\t2\t1372211\t2\t1372214\t2\t1372218\t2\t1372224\t2\t1372243\t2\t13721004\t2\t13721035\t2\t13721078\t2\t13721089\t2\t13721091\t2\t13721207\t2\t13721264\t2\t13721264\t2\t13721297\t2\t13721303\t2\t13721356\t2\t13721356\t2\t13721356\t2\t13721356\t2\t13721364\t2\t13721368\t2\t13721368\t2\t13721370\t2\t13721370\t2\t13721370\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721372\t2\t13721373\t2\t13721374\t2\t13721374\t2\t13721374\t2\t13721374\t2\t13721374\t2\t13721375\t2\t13721375\t2\t13721376\t2\t13721376\t2\t13721377\t2\t13721377\t2\t13721383\t2\t13721396\t2\t13721396\t2\t1372307\t2\t1372307\t2\t1372330\t2\t1372357\t2\t1372376\t2\t1372378\t2\t1372",

    "words": "A survey of the information use patterns and communication practicesof academic physicists in the  greater Boston area reveals that academicphysicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information.  Theiruse of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles.Time and location factors play an important rolein their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of thephysicists surveyed do not seek librarians' help when searching forinformation in the library.

    "words": "The following pages form the concluding portion of four lecturesdelivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Readerin Bibliography, 1921.As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classesof the community, I have decided to print them separately, thoughthe underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity inbook classification as a preliminary to co-operative action inlibrary administration and bibliography.Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classificationcarried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformityin the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this achronological order of books in their classes and your scheme ofclassification acquires a new value; for it presents for each perioda bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of theactivities of the human mind.My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practicalapplication to library work and the compilation of subjectbibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered inrelation to the growth of modern civilization.Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography endswith the presentation of the figures compiled.

It deals with abstract configurationscalled digraphs, which consist of \"points\" and \"directed lines.\"  Whenthese terms are given concrete referents, digraphs serve as mathematicalmodels of empirical structures, and properties of digraphs reflectstructural properties of the empirical world.

The latterforces the seeker of information to sort through many itemsto find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, andma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of theconcept an entry should be made..X400\t2\t1392404\t2\t1392458\t2\t1392459\t2\t1392493\t2\t1392548\t2\t1392627\t2\t1392627\t2\t139216\t2\t1392770\t2\t1392796\t2\t1392802\t2\t1392863\t2\t1392864\t2\t1392897\t2\t1392114\t2\t1392114\t2\t1392154\t2\t1392169\t2\t1392194\t2\t1392990\t2\t1392212\t2\t1392235\t2\t1392250\t2\t1392289\t2\t1392289\t2\t13921073\t2\t13921152\t2\t13921368\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921392\t2\t13921414\t2\t13921431\t2\t13921448\t2\t13921448\t2\t1392345\t2\t1392",

However,although it was possible to teach these new approaches, there was noone textbook which covered the subject approach in the way that I feltwas needed.  The first edition was intended to fill this gap, and itsreception, both in Britain and abroad, showed that it did indeed fulfill areal need.  It met with a very positive welcome from lecturers and -more importantly - from students, particularly in the United States,where British textbooks on classification had previously been regardedwith something akin to suspicion.

In this book I have tried to cover thewhole subject, starting with introductory material and leading to themore advanced topics, assuming a minimal technical background on thepart of the reader.  I did not attempt to provide detailed techniquesfor the design of specific circuits, but rather to formulate methods and todevelop algorithms that can be applied to a broad class of problems.For once such general principles are understood, the relevance of specificprocedures and their applicability to given problems are a matter ofengineering decisions..X416\t2\t1398417\t2\t1398417\t2\t1398417\t2\t1398430\t2\t1398430\t2\t1398430\t2\t1398430\t2\t1398442\t2\t1398443\t2\t1398443\t2\t1398443\t2\t1398443\t2\t1398455\t2\t1398455\t2\t1398455\t2\t1398455\t2\t1398464\t2\t1398464\t2\t1398464\t2\t1398495\t2\t1398511\t2\t1398524\t2\t1398745\t2\t1398745\t2\t1398745\t2\t1398745\t2\t1398228\t2\t13981194\t2\t13981204\t2\t13981204\t2\t13981204\t2\t13981396\t2\t13981398\t2\t13981398\t2\t13981398\t2\t13981398\t2\t13981398\t2\t13981427\t2\t13981427\t2\t13981427\t2\t1398329\t2\t1398397\t2\t1398397\t2\t1398397\t2\t1398",

    "words": "This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense(as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed tophonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to constructa formalized general theory of linguistic structure and toexplore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorousformulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation thanmere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-establishedmethods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed modelsfor linguistic structure can play an important role, both negativeand positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precisebut inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we canoften expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently,gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively,a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for manyproblems other than those for which it was explicitly designed.Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurdconclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail tobe useful in two important respects..X417\t2\t1399443\t2\t1399546\t2\t1399558\t2\t1399558\t2\t1399572\t2\t1399572\t2\t1399608\t2\t1399628\t2\t1399653\t2\t139921\t2\t1399118\t2\t1399149\t2\t1399168\t2\t1399168\t2\t1399168\t2\t1399168\t2\t1399168\t2\t1399175\t2\t1399902\t2\t1399902\t2\t13991046\t2\t13991046\t2\t13991046\t2\t13991118\t2\t13991265\t2\t13991310\t2\t13991327\t2\t13991386\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991399\t2\t13991443\t2\t1399317\t2\t1399317\t2\t1399317\t2\t1399320\t2\t1399332\t2\t1399",

    "words": "Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relatingto their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed duringthe last decade and a half.  The criticism usually relates to therecognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact-finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist inthe research activities of others rather than to conduct their own.  Onecan add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours aweek on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time onoriginal research or the writing of proposals, which either are notadequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for.  Ifthe librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionallycriticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limitedinterest to the reviewer.  Or he finds that while many praise his work thereare no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusionsinto action..X406\t2\t1403453\t2\t1403598\t2\t1403616\t2\t1403629\t2\t1403648\t2\t1403652\t2\t1403779\t2\t1403896\t2\t1403128\t2\t1403130\t2\t1403171\t2\t1403191\t2\t1403923\t2\t1403924\t2\t1403948\t2\t1403946\t2\t1403217\t2\t1403230\t2\t1403232\t2\t1403241\t2\t1403243\t2\t1403249\t2\t14031033\t2\t14031079\t2\t14031242\t2\t14031250\t2\t14031376\t2\t14031379\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031403\t2\t14031423\t2\t14031428\t2\t14031457\t2\t1403331\t2\t1403339\t2\t1403339\t2\t1403339\t2\t1403358\t2\t1403364\t2\t1403371\t2\t1403370\t2\t1403376\t2\t1403385\t2\t1403387\t2\t1403387\t2\t1403387\t2\t1403",

Its basis is a body of survey data collectedfrom 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporationsand from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired usefultechnical information from sources outside their immediate circle ofcolleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functionalapproach in which the use of various means of information transfer isconsidered in relation to the purposes of technical work..While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of thissort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means willvary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report exploresthe association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational,and technological factors with variations in the use of sources ofinformation.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, thosevariations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which theinformation was applied..The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions,one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some bodyof systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operationalobjectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informalsources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and moredistant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on\"professional\" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge..In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have,within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the needfor managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay inthis process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formaland social groups..

    "author": "Studer, William Joseph",
    "words": "From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted apilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalogcards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data basefor an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty withbiweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specifiedfields of interest..Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest inparticipating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participantscould be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number offaculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10,economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3..An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into bothLibrary of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject headingterms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash,parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OFbecomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting\"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching withsubject headings and class numbers..The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARCrecords.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6..Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that thesum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less thanthe hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of aparticular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that ahit would occur on any matching number..Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. ProgramExtract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number(accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for currentrecords; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those inthe profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print comparedthese card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copiesof each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the facultymember's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be usedfor making recommendations to the library..Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC filemainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record,whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record'ssecond or third heading..The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selectingrelevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable..

Two major approaches, viz., thefrequency domain approach and the time domain approach, are considered.. Thetechniques developed overcome many difficulties that are associated withoptimization problems in distributed parameter systems..In the frequency domain, distributed systems described by the general(linear) telegrapher's equations are considered, over a finite band offrequencies.. An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed..Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulatedin terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles oflumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems..Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation arediscussed..In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method ofsolution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systemsare considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along thecharacteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages..

    "author": "Lister, Winston Charles",
    "words": "For the last several decades library collections have been growing atexponential rates with no relief evident in the future..To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections,many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories forlittle-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storagesystem are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and thecriteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This studydemonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storagequantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and thesmall shelving costs associated with stored materials..Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and theother utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost criticalage at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines thefraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that thecirculation rate of the books decline with age according to an averagegeometric pattern of obsolescence..The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books isutilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decisionvariable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usagerate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time thata book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without beingused.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for whichthe time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence,although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the compositedistribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends uponthe circulation activities of the individual libraries..An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collectedfrom three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parametersextracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rulesand the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized fromstorage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of thecollection must be stored..Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that thelatter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situationwhere the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unitrelocation cost..Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of valuesshow that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relativelyinsignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in thecapacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results;and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation costdifferential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rathersubjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have apotentially large influence on the decision rules...X415\t2\t1417435\t2\t1417458\t2\t1417471\t2\t1417481\t2\t1417483\t2\t1417485\t2\t1417494\t2\t1417515\t2\t1417545\t2\t1417552\t2\t1417587\t2\t1417587\t2\t1417587\t2\t1417605\t2\t1417613\t2\t1417614\t2\t1417638\t2\t1417667\t2\t141731\t2\t141733\t2\t141736\t2\t141736\t2\t141736\t2\t141741\t2\t141741\t2\t141746\t2\t141746\t2\t141746\t2\t1417735\t2\t1417747\t2\t1417748\t2\t1417750\t2\t1417750\t2\t1417751\t2\t1417753\t2\t1417759\t2\t1417760\t2\t1417765\t2\t1417766\t2\t1417767\t2\t1417767\t2\t1417767\t2\t141757\t2\t1417774\t2\t1417775\t2\t1417778\t2\t1417778\t2\t1417779\t2\t1417780\t2\t1417782\t2\t1417784\t2\t1417786\t2\t1417787\t2\t1417788\t2\t1417789\t2\t1417791\t2\t1417792\t2\t1417792\t2\t1417793\t2\t1417793\t2\t141761\t2\t141762\t2\t141762\t2\t141767\t2\t141767\t2\t141770\t2\t141771\t2\t141772\t2\t141773\t2\t141781\t2\t141789\t2\t141797\t2\t1417800\t2\t1417800\t2\t1417808\t2\t1417823\t2\t1417840\t2\t1417840\t2\t1417891\t2\t1417102\t2\t1417111\t2\t1417112\t2\t1417115\t2\t1417135\t2\t1417163\t2\t1417172\t2\t1417175\t2\t1417181\t2\t1417182\t2\t1417183\t2\t1417183\t2\t1417184\t2\t1417184\t2\t1417184\t2\t1417193\t2\t1417193\t2\t1417193\t2\t1417195\t2\t1417195\t2\t1417198\t2\t1417199\t2\t1417905\t2\t1417905\t2\t1417907\t2\t1417925\t2\t1417925\t2\t1417925\t2\t1417925\t2\t1417948\t2\t1417952\t2\t1417953\t2\t1417953\t2\t1417964\t2\t1417968\t2\t1417977\t2\t1417981\t2\t1417982\t2\t1417983\t2\t1417983\t2\t1417201\t2\t1417201\t2\t1417203\t2\t1417203\t2\t1417204\t2\t1417206\t2\t1417207\t2\t1417208\t2\t1417205\t2\t1417210\t2\t1417222\t2\t1417225\t2\t1417233\t2\t1417267\t2\t1417267\t2\t1417267\t2\t1417269\t2\t1417269\t2\t1417269\t2\t1417280\t2\t14171009\t2\t14171016\t2\t14171018\t2\t14171019\t2\t14171019\t2\t14171019\t2\t14171023\t2\t14171030\t2\t14171055\t2\t14171081\t2\t14171083\t2\t14171085\t2\t14171086\t2\t14171087\t2\t14171082\t2\t14171082\t2\t14171090\t2\t14171135\t2\t14171184\t2\t14171187\t2\t14171201\t2\t14171203\t2\t14171219\t2\t14171219\t2\t14171219\t2\t14171240\t2\t14171260\t2\t14171268\t2\t14171275\t2\t14171276\t2\t14171278\t2\t14171278\t2\t14171280\t2\t14171285\t2\t14171286\t2\t14171287\t2\t14171302\t2\t14171324\t2\t14171335\t2\t14171358\t2\t14171359\t2\t14171390\t2\t14171397\t2\t14171397\t2\t14171400\t2\t14171401\t2\t14171401\t2\t14171402\t2\t14171410\t2\t14171416\t2\t14171416\t2\t14171416\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171417\t2\t14171418\t2\t14171418\t2\t14171418\t2\t14171426\t2\t14171428\t2\t14171432\t2\t14171450\t2\t1417359\t2\t1417360\t2\t1417373\t2\t1417382\t2\t1417395\t2\t1417395\t2\t1417",

    "words": "Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research..Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the majorresponsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Mostuniversities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specializedlibraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. Thisuse of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally,resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines..The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that thisdivision of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular toexamine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and thescattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns..These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of librarysystems..Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actuallyestimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data aredeveloped.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has itsadvantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually maderelative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines canbe defined in comparable terms.. A \"discipline wheel\" is proposed which canserve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines..This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline andalso for measuring the similarity between two disciplines..One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the studyof journal productivity is the concept of \"scattering\" of articles or \"titledispersion\".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which hasresulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradforddistribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from varioussources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly theYule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered..The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, andevaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use indetermining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of addingadditional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, andbuilding mathematical models of library systems are among some of theapplications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivityfunctions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system asa function of the number of subscriptions it receives..The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to whichthe above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data wascollected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D.dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Completerecords of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained..The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generallysatisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientificdisciplines is measured as is the similaritybetween the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is alsomeasured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system'sholdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposedand evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions..This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such conceptsas title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity betweendisciplines, and others..

    "words": "Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerousproblems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical ofthese problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability,storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problemsis presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility andadvantages..The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posterioriautomatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility isdemonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 documentdescriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated byestablishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems andapplying these measures to a number of different classification strategies..By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual andone automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon theindexing method used..It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied,one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. Inaddition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at leastas good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, asthe a priori, manual classification system currently in use with theaforementioned file..The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying afile of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are includedas an appendix to this dissertation...X409\t2\t1419422\t2\t1419448\t2\t1419454\t2\t1419462\t2\t1419479\t2\t1419480\t2\t1419483\t2\t1419483\t2\t1419484\t2\t1419485\t2\t1419486\t2\t1419488\t2\t1419491\t2\t1419493\t2\t1419503\t2\t1419507\t2\t1419509\t2\t1419510\t2\t1419512\t2\t1419514\t2\t1419517\t2\t1419520\t2\t1419520\t2\t1419522\t2\t1419527\t2\t1419528\t2\t1419531\t2\t1419564\t2\t1419565\t2\t1419566\t2\t1419570\t2\t1419576\t2\t1419581\t2\t1419586\t2\t1419596\t2\t1419603\t2\t1419604\t2\t1419608\t2\t1419608\t2\t1419633\t2\t1419636\t2\t1419643\t2\t1419659\t2\t1419659\t2\t1419661\t2\t1419662\t2\t1419663\t2\t1419678\t2\t1419682\t2\t141945\t2\t1419715\t2\t1419737\t2\t1419754\t2\t141951\t2\t1419769\t2\t1419790\t2\t141962\t2\t141969\t2\t141971\t2\t141977\t2\t141979\t2\t141986\t2\t1419805\t2\t1419809\t2\t1419810\t2\t1419812\t2\t1419813\t2\t1419814\t2\t1419817\t2\t1419820\t2\t1419824\t2\t1419825\t2\t1419853\t2\t1419875\t2\t1419883\t2\t1419894\t2\t1419894\t2\t1419168\t2\t1419174\t2\t1419175\t2\t1419175\t2\t1419176\t2\t14191051\t2\t14191274\t2\t14191294\t2\t14191313\t2\t14191327\t2\t14191327\t2\t14191327\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191419\t2\t14191427\t2\t1419310\t2\t1419310\t2\t1419315\t2\t1419318\t2\t1419324\t2\t1419363\t2\t1419382\t2\t1419382\t2\t1419389\t2\t1419390\t2\t1419",

As early as 1608,when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, \"he proposed theestablishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student.  ButSir Thomas Bodley was opposed.\"  So it is to Harvard that we turn for anexample of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight.Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities andtheir libraries were relatively small until this century.  More important,they were largely undergraduate institutions.  The great expansion ofgraduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon.  The problems of theundergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded bythe striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasison the acquisition of materials suitable for research.The large university collections became increasingly difficult for theundergraduate to use.  When he had to select his books from the card catalogand obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might wellabandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out,missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes.

Together they form a unique, integratedsystem capable of parsing, interpreting, and acting upon the informationcontained in complex natural language discourse..X417\t2\t1427417\t2\t1427417\t2\t1427430\t2\t1427430\t2\t1427430\t2\t1427443\t2\t1427443\t2\t1427443\t2\t1427448\t2\t1427455\t2\t1427455\t2\t1427455\t2\t1427464\t2\t1427464\t2\t1427464\t2\t1427480\t2\t1427483\t2\t1427484\t2\t1427484\t2\t1427484\t2\t1427486\t2\t1427488\t2\t1427491\t2\t1427493\t2\t1427503\t2\t1427507\t2\t1427508\t2\t1427509\t2\t1427509\t2\t1427510\t2\t1427512\t2\t1427517\t2\t1427519\t2\t1427520\t2\t1427522\t2\t1427523\t2\t1427526\t2\t1427527\t2\t1427528\t2\t1427528\t2\t1427531\t2\t1427534\t2\t1427546\t2\t1427565\t2\t1427565\t2\t1427566\t2\t1427579\t2\t1427581\t2\t1427594\t2\t1427596\t2\t1427603\t2\t1427606\t2\t1427608\t2\t1427625\t2\t1427626\t2\t1427633\t2\t1427637\t2\t1427643\t2\t1427659\t2\t1427660\t2\t142726\t2\t1427715\t2\t1427745\t2\t1427745\t2\t1427745\t2\t1427754\t2\t142751\t2\t142754\t2\t1427780\t2\t1427785\t2\t1427790\t2\t142769\t2\t142771\t2\t142777\t2\t142779\t2\t142773\t2\t1427805\t2\t1427809\t2\t1427810\t2\t1427810\t2\t1427812\t2\t1427813\t2\t1427814\t2\t1427817\t2\t1427824\t2\t1427825\t2\t1427826\t2\t1427830\t2\t1427894\t2\t1427168\t2\t1427175\t2\t1427176\t2\t14271051\t2\t14271185\t2\t14271204\t2\t14271204\t2\t14271204\t2\t14271232\t2\t14271294\t2\t14271307\t2\t14271327\t2\t14271374\t2\t14271385\t2\t14271398\t2\t14271398\t2\t14271398\t2\t14271419\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t14271427\t2\t1427310\t2\t1427315\t2\t1427319\t2\t1427320\t2\t1427321\t2\t1427332\t2\t1427382\t2\t1427397\t2\t1427397\t2\t1427397\t2\t1427399\t2\t1427",

Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt:We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguisticproblem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light -negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in generalare like..X488\t2\t1443489\t2\t1443493\t2\t1443499\t2\t1443499\t2\t1443498\t2\t1443558\t2\t1443570\t2\t1443572\t2\t1443572\t2\t1443581\t2\t1443590\t2\t1443590\t2\t1443659\t2\t1443664\t2\t1443790\t2\t144377\t2\t144379\t2\t1443819\t2\t1443117\t2\t1443168\t2\t1443168\t2\t1443168\t2\t1443168\t2\t1443175\t2\t14431024\t2\t14431027\t2\t14431045\t2\t14431046\t2\t14431046\t2\t14431046\t2\t14431047\t2\t14431118\t2\t14431213\t2\t14431215\t2\t14431231\t2\t14431294\t2\t14431389\t2\t14431399\t2\t14431443\t2\t14431443\t2\t14431443\t2\t14431443\t2\t14431443\t2\t14431443\t2\t1443317\t2\t1443317\t2\t1443320\t2\t1443320\t2\t1443320\t2\t1443",

The long-term concern is the questionof how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library thatcan be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-termconcern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing cardcatalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to userrequirements.

Weapons Acquisition is defined toinclude the conception, development, and production of technicallyadvanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Processemphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weaponsprograms, including the actions, reactions, and interactions ofgovernment agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicatesour concern with how these activities and relationships affect thequality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs.The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge ofthese facets of weapons development and production.  Such anobjective classified the volume as a social science, rather thanadministrative study.  Yet most social science research,however \"pure\" the form, is ultimately directed at changing publicpolicy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with aspecific set of public policy recommendations.

As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal withthe acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is oneof the best techniques available for the long-range building of usefulcollections.4.

The rule is sometimesexpressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100as the phenomena relate to the relationships betweenthe two statistical measures..X2\t2\t1451475\t2\t1451552\t2\t1451684\t2\t145124\t2\t145131\t2\t1451760\t2\t1451767\t2\t1451774\t2\t1451775\t2\t1451778\t2\t1451788\t2\t1451788\t2\t1451789\t2\t1451789\t2\t145174\t2\t145175\t2\t145176\t2\t1451111\t2\t1451119\t2\t1451122\t2\t1451132\t2\t1451137\t2\t1451139\t2\t1451152\t2\t1451155\t2\t1451183\t2\t1451183\t2\t1451193\t2\t1451195\t2\t1451955\t2\t1451961\t2\t1451977\t2\t1451977\t2\t1451201\t2\t1451203\t2\t1451204\t2\t1451210\t2\t1451269\t2\t14511011\t2\t14511055\t2\t14511056\t2\t14511203\t2\t14511275\t2\t14511352\t2\t14511451\t2\t14511451\t2\t14511451\t2\t14511451\t2\t14511451\t2\t14511451\t2\t1451336\t2\t1451",

For the past hundred years, eversince structural chemistry began, chemists have been using graphicsymbols in this way.
